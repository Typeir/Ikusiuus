# **Binturia**

## *Common*

**Binturia** is a northern secular nation characterized by its militaristic ethos and the unique cultural identity of its inhabitants, the **Sunborn**. This federation comprises several states that have come together under a loose alliance, primarily for mutual defense and shared economic interests.

The citizens of **Binturia** view the **Sunborn** as beings of superior potential. This perception fosters a sense of pride among Binturians, who celebrate the **Sunborn** as embodiments of resilience and adaptability. The federation's military was one of the largest in **Damocles** before it's defeat during **The War of the Mists**, when it was defeated by the **Brume Empire** and about half of it's territorial claims taken by them.

In everyday life, Binturians participate in communal activities that celebrate their heritage and warrior culture. Training camps and military drills are common, with citizens encouraged to participate from a young age. However, there is also a focus on education and muscial arts, promoting a poet-warrior ideal deeply rooted in their folklore.

At the helm of **Binturia** is the **High Comairle**, a governing body comprised of the most esteemed military leaders from each of the member states. This council operates under a framework that allows for shared governance, but ultimately, the northen toll-town of **Gemraedgh** with it's recently acquired veto power is the de-facto ruler of **Binturia**.

**Binturia** lacks a centralized religion, but the **Cult of Kuutar** has gained a somewhat ambiguous relationship with the federation. The cult, which venerates the fallen goddess **Kuutar**, has followers among the **Sunborn**, who view the moon-touched as saviors and await the return of their Messiah, **Ludwig**, the moon-blade. Some of the **Binturian Hinterlands** higher-ups belong to the cult.

## *Deep*

Unlike the **Borossan Kingdom**, where **Sunborn** are seen as equal to humans, Binturians perceive them as somewhat superior, viewing their unique traits and powers as evidence of their elevated status.

During their occupation of **The Moon's gambit**, the **Binturian Federation** recovered old documents and tablets depicting the creation of **Moon-touched God-warriors**, such as **Ludwig The Blood Plague**, and started working on a program codenamed **Last Eclipse**, in which they would attempt to create new **Moon-touched** warriors, to varying degrees of success.

**Binturia** is a highly traditionalist place, which has led to their technology becoming stagnant in the face of the pursuit of martial mastery. This has caused an increased wave of pirate attacks, who no longer view them as a big threat.

## *Truth*

**Aislinget Lirinargh** of **Gemraedgh**, de-facto ruler of **Binturia**, along with other Binturian **state-province** rulers such as, **Cillianet Chaoim** of **Faolett**, or **Sorchargh Chaoim** of **Byrnen**, have communed with the **Blood Queen**, now simply known as **Mother moon**, and have supplied her with resources and information regarding the **Golden Path**, in exchange of perfecting their new **Moon-touched** systems and providing them with a steady supply of **Bloodletters** and **Lunar Kystepods** to use in their upcoming war efforts against the **Brume**.

**Aislinget** in particular has subjected his progeny, **Fionnulet Lirinargh** and **Tadhgen Lirinargh**, to the **moon-touching** ritual, having both of them serve as his personal guard in a paramillitary association known as **The Silver Hands**.
