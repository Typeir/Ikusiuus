1. **The Descent into the Chasm**  
   - The party used **Ukko’s stone-shaping abilities** to carve makeshift scaffolding to secure their ropes.

## 📖 **Session Recap**  
The party **descended into the Sunken City**, witnessing **a horrifying sight**—the still-living, decayed **veins of Päivätär**, filled with **swarming Golden Claspers**, like blood cells in a dying god. **Sigus suffered intense psychic backlash** from the sight, barely warning the others in time.  

Navigating the ruined city, they were **ambushed by spiked crustacean beasts**, nearly **losing Lacuna** before **escaping into an abandoned Pieni home**, where they **rested beneath the floorboards**.  

The next day, **Lystig led them to an old church**, a **converted Empyrean structure**. There, they discovered **unsettling footprints**—one set **belonging to a six-toed figure, possibly linked to the Red Queen**, and another set **belonging to someone armored in iron**. They also recovered **an ancient, damaged suit of armor** before leaving.  

As they moved through the ruins, **Ukko noticed strange spirits following them**. The **Väki**, small, skeletal creatures with whirlwind heads, watched in silence. Rather than attacking, they **pointed toward the patrolling Colossus**, seemingly guiding them.  

Realizing that the **Väki were trying to tell them something**, the party began planning their next move—was the **Colossus a guardian, a key, or simply another horror standing in their way**?
