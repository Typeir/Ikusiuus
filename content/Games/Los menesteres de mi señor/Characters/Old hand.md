# THE OLD HAND - LORE

*You built a small rat hole that you BARELY fit into in the secondary pantry when this stead was first constructed, over thirty years ago.
You knew the good wine would be there, and you were right.
The hole connects to the lower chambers, but it is now flooded, and you can't get through without getting soaked.
You don't really have a key, but you installed almost every single lock in this place; you know how to force them.
It's been a tenday since you were there, and the day before yesterday, when you were going to get new clothes out of the chest,
you realized you forgot your room and chest key there. Thankfully, you usually leave your door open.*
