## (1) The Study

- ### a

  - A **whitelight torch** can be found here.

- ### b

  - **Keys to the lower chambers** are located in this room.

- ### c

  - A **black scale** can be discovered here. A **Natural World roll** will reveal that it is not natural. An **Occult roll** (Hard if **Anaximandro's diary** hasn't been read) will allow investigators to recognize it as belonging to **Nigredo**.

---

## (2) The Locked Wing

- ### a

  - All the **doors to this part of the house are locked.**

- ### b

  - The place is covered in **carrion and corpses,** all mauled by hooves and full of handprints. There is black miasma here too, causing a 3/3d10 sanity loss.

- ### c

  - **Anaximandro's diary** can be found here, noting that he made contact with **Nigredo** for the first time about three cycles ago, and that he managed to step "Beyond the Dream" shortly after with **Nigredo's** guidance.

---

## (3) The Kitchen

- ### a

  - The food here is not rotten, and someone has cooked an **extremely weird dish,** almost indescribable.
  - The smell is foul, but it tastes great. It will heal 2d10 sanity if consumed, but only the first time.

---

## (4) The Lower Master's chamber

- ### a

  - A **brutalized horse,** stomped with hooves, is found here. *Sanity loss.* There is a huge hole in the wall sewn with black silk. A **Hard Spot Hidden roll** reveals the full extent of the damage.
  - The sight of the **horse** results in a 2/2d10 sanity loss. A **Hard Natural World roll** allows for an **Occult roll**; **Hard Natural World** reveals the wounds are of unknown origin, and **Occult** confirms that they are not natural but offers no further explanation.

---

## (5) The Antechamber and the laboratory

- ### a

  - The **water is pitch black** and there are two horses floating in the water that can be seen if the area is illuminated by a strong light (like a torch).
  - If someone tries to wade through the water in the darkness after noon, the horses will attack. If the investigator being attacked does not succeed on a **Hard Spot Hidden roll** or a **flat DEX roll**, they will be surprised. Each horse attacks once, dealing 1d6 damage, then they submerge.
  - The **key to the secondary pantry** is still where the new hand left it.

- ### b

  - After 6 PM, **Nigredo** will grow tired of waiting for **Anaximandro** to return and will bust the door open. He will not directly harm any of the investigators and will try to hide from them if he hasn't been found yet. If found, he will talk with the investigators and provoke them to attack him first, but he will warn them that the only way he can hurt them directly is if they try to hurt him first.
  - **Nigredo** cannot lie, but he can choose not to reply. He will block the entrance to the room.
  - *A combat with Nigredo is certain death.*

- ### c

  - If the investigators manage to get inside before **Nigredo** opens the door or get through him, he will either stalk or pester them while they wade through the laboratory.
  - *Merely being in the laboratory is as harmful as being in the tunnels from the farmland.* The same effects apply here.
  - There are a lot of **whitelight shards** floating about near every desk. **Nigredo** does not go near them, nor does he approach the investigators holding whitelight torches or the halberd.

- ### d

  - There are several items related to **Anaximandro's research,** bottles containing pockets of the hidden kingdom, dissected denizens of the bizarre realms, and other such items.
  - If the investigators open one of the bottles containing a pocket of the hidden kingdom, they will risk being sucked in. They must succeed a **DEX roll** to close the bottle, or be sucked in and be discarded from the adventure. **Nigredo** will warn them of this outcome if he has been found.
  - If the dissected denizens are examined, 2/2d10 sanity will be lost.

- ### e

  - **Aristides's corpse** can be found here too. **Nigredo** will puppet it around if the players have been overly hostile to him. *1/1d10 sanity loss or 4/4d6 loss if it's being puppeted.*
  - Additionally, if **Nigredo** is pressured to stop, a combat encounter against **Aristides** will occur. He will use the ghoul stats.

- ### f

  - A **crackling portal to the hidden kingdom** is at the back of the room. It seems highly unstable as the interlocking has not happened yet.
  - If an investigator goes in, roll 1d10. On a 10, the portal closes and **Nigredo** goes into a frenzy and calls all of his living servants to kill the remaining investigators.
  - Otherwise, the investigator gets a glimpse of the old gods of the hidden kingdom, and they must succeed a **Hard INT roll** and go back from where they came, or take an 8/10d6 sanity loss. If they refuse to leave they will have to roll yet another **Hard INT roll** with **1 Penalty die**. If they succeed, they may stay in the hidden kingdom. Otherwise their brain will combust and they will die instantly.

---

## (6) The Stable Yard

- ### a

  - **Three horses are missing today.** But **Aristides's horse** has somehow returned. The horse looks pristine, but if someone removes its saddle, they will find out that the creature is wounded.
  - Depending on the order of tasks, the wound might be simple scratches (first task) or its entire spine missing (last task). If the task is performed after noon, the horse will go mad when its saddle is removed, and it will attack the investigator, biting them for 1d6 damage twice before fleeing. The investigators who witnessed this will take 1 sanity point of loss for each hour after 12 AM, maxing out at 4 PM.

---

## (7) The Dining Hall

- ### b

  - The keeper must roll 1d10 at noon and at sundown, for lunch and dinnertime, if the **blighted cook** is still alive. If it lands on a 5 or higher, the food is blighted. A **nature check** will allow investigators to find it out.
  - If the **blighted food** is consumed, everyone becomes inoculated with blight, and after one hour, they will take a 4/5d10 sanity loss from visions of insects and rotting corpses.

---

## (8) The Doctor's Room

- ### a

  - Just before noon, the **injured landshark** will escape and try to brutalize a peasant. If the encounter is far away, roll the dice in secret. If the landshark wins the fight, it will flee to the master's quarters.
  - The landshark uses the black bear monster sheet but it only has 12 hit points.
  - A **Spot Hidden roll** will reveal its trail.

---

## (9) The Beehouse

- ### a

  - The place has a **murderous mystique** about it. If an investigator other than the farmhand succeeds on a **Hard Spot Hidden roll,** they will find the document that clears the murder charges stashed away somewhere.

---

## (10) The Barracks

- ### a

  - The **barracks become locked after noon.** There are plenty of weapons and defensive equipment in there, no check required. 1d4 plate armors, and 1d6 simple armors can be found there. 1d6 longswords, 1d4 spears, and 1 **Thealassian Guard Regent Halberd** can be found there. A **Warfare-related roll** is required to don the plate armor.
  - **Plate armor** reduces all incoming damage by 2, simple armor by 1. Simple armor will break after it has reduced 10 damage.
  - The **Thealassian Guard Regent Halberd** is laced with whitelight crystals and will deal an extra 1d6 damage to blighted creatures.

---

## (11) The Stables

- ### a

  - At sundown, the **dead bees will start moving.** Roll a dice appropriate for the number of investigators, count clockwise with the rolled number. The investigator it lands on will be chased by the bees, and the bees will continue to get back up until burned by a live flame or exposed to a **whitelight torch.** A **Hard Natural World roll** will notice the bees' muscles twitch slightly ever so often.
  - **Honeyed hoofprints** can be found all over the stable. A **Spot Hidden roll** will reveal them.

---

## (12) Aristides's Room

- ### a

  - **There are hoofprints.** A **Natural World roll** will discern a weird walking pattern, and will realize they go into the lower chambers.
  - A **Hard Spot Hidden roll** will find one of **Aristides's boots** behind a wardrobe.

---

## (13) Herbalist's Bedroom

- ### a

  - The **herbalist's bedside pot plant** is a blighted mandrake, but it will not attack the herbalist or the doctor.

---

## (14) The Woods

- ### a

  - One of the **maids is missing.** A **Track roll** can find her path into the woods, where her mauled corpse can be found. The Keeper will roll 1d10. If the result is 5 or higher, a **Blighted Landshark Matriarch** ambushes the party.
  - A **Hard Spot Hidden roll** will allow for an **Occult roll** to note the otherworldly sickness.
  - A **Medicine roll** will just note a sickness. A **Handle Animal, Hard Intimidate, or Hard Natural World roll** will make the creature calm down or go away. Otherwise, a combat scene happens.
  - This creature uses the black bear monster sheet. After the fight, if the investigators survive but got hit by the beast, they must make a **CON roll** or be inoculated with blight.

---

## (15) Guardpost

- ### b

  - An **Art/Craft roll** on this tenday's records will have the investigator realize **Aristides's last signature is a forgery.** A **Hard Spot Hidden roll** will find that something is wrong with it, but not what.

---

## (16) Kitchen

- ### a

  - **Rudimentary combat tools** can be acquired here. A simple **Spot Hidden roll** will reveal 1d10 kitchen knives and utensils (1d6 + DB). On a critical success, a fueled kebab spear is found, from one of the chefs from **Cavar.** The chef will want it returned if he sees it and might get aggressive about it. The chef is blighted.
  - The spear is an impaling weapon, has three charges, and each time a charge is used, it will deal an additional 1d4 fire damage.

---

## (17) The Pantry

- ### a

  - The **old hand has a key to the hatch,** but the pantry is suspiciously closed. The new hand left a spare key in the entrance to the lower chambers. It has been flooded.

---

## (18) Apothecary's stash

- ### a

  - Some of the **herbs have become vectors of Nigredo's vile aura of death.** If someone picks herbs to synthesize into antidotes, they must roll a **Hard Spot Hidden roll** or a **Natural World or Medicine roll** to distinguish between the blighted ones.
  - If the wrong herb is picked and synthesized into an antidote, a **blight explosion** will occur, inflicting all investigators standing near the exploding object with 2d6 damage and imposing a 3/3d10 sanity loss. Otherwise, the antidote works as normal. The antidote must contain a speck of **whitelight.** These can be obtained by extinguishing one of the three torches, flaking away the decorative whitelight from the halberd, or taking it from one of the 10 bottles in the laboratory.

- ### b

  - Some of the **blighted herbs have become black mandrakes.** These creatures have 3HP each. Roll d10, divide by two. That's how many mandrakes there are. They will be on a different shelf each, and they remain passive until approached. At that point, they will spit black mists. The investigator must make a **CON roll** or be inoculated with blight.
  - The creatures can also use their claws to attack, each dealing 1d4+1 damage to the investigator, on a 40% **Brawl roll.** They cannot dodge or block, and they move so slowly that just walking away and closing the door will end the encounter.

---

## (19) The Mill and Farmland

- ### a

  - **There is a huge hole in the mill wall,** clumsily covered with battered boxes. A **Hard Spot Hidden roll** will reveal the hole easily. A **Masonry** skill roll will indicate the makeshift nature of the repairs, and a **Natural World** skill roll will reveal misty webbing left behind by an unknown creature.
  - The hole leads into the beekeep, where it has been further hidden with planks that are covered in scratches and hoofprints.

- ### b

  - **There is a series of hidden, flooded tunnels** beneath the farmland. When the investigators remove dead crops, roll 1d10. On a 10, the ground caves in, and the investigator must make a **DEX roll** or fall into the tunnels. A successful **Climb roll** will allow an investigator to escape the tunnels.
  - These tunnels are the reason the well is clogged, as they are filled with a thick black mist that drains the sanity of anyone who enters.
  - If an investigator spends longer than a minute inside, they will be invaded by visions of chitinous creatures and must succeed in a **Hard INT roll** or **Occult roll** to avoid taking 2/1d10 sanity damage.
  - If they spend yet another minute inside, the check is repeated, and the sanity loss is doubled to 4/2d10. The investigator will also gain the **Arachnophobia** trait.
  - If another minute is spent inside the mists, the loss becomes 10/5d10.
  - If a fourth roll is failed, the investigator instantly dies and is consumed by the black mist.
  - If a character is holding a **whitelight torch**, the mist dissipates.
  - When the investigators reach the base of the unclogged well while carrying this torch, they will find a passage leading to the flooded lower chambers.

---

## (20) Doctor's Office

- ### a

  - **If someone tries to use one of the med kits** from the doctor's office, they will have to roll a **Hard Spot Hidden roll** or a **Medicine roll**.
  - If they don't succeed, the medicine kit they pick up will be blighted by **Nigredo,** and it will inflict a sickness upon the investigator, chosen from the bouts of madness table, along with a 10/10d10 sanity loss.

---

## (21) The Well

- ### a

  - **The well exhudes noxious fumes.** If an investigator looks over the edge, they must succeed on a **CON roll** or risk falling into the well. Other investigators can attempt to grab them before they fall, using any **DEX** or physical skill roll the Keeper deems adequate.
  - A **Masonry** skill roll will reveal that many of the rocks in the well have been battered or disturbed recently.
  - A **Natural World** skill roll will reveal hoofprints on the walls of the well, indicating the presence of something unnatural.
