# Cornucopio (Taedan swamp Demon-frogs)

## ![Frog](/library/images/Hydroloth.jpg)

## Background

_The frogs are also known as "Cornucopios" by the locals, sarcastically named so for their eternal hunger, in reference to the eternal abundance of a Cornucopia. These creatures are the spawn of hiisi, both major and minor, and while they resemble frogs, their amorphous shape betrays them as what they are - Demonspawns -. These creatures are not so much living organisms as they are extensions of another entity. In this case, they're the discarded flesh of Rubedo and Xanthous, after they lost a great deal of deal-power during the scarring_
