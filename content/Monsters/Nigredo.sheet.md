## Traits

**Endless Form.**  
Nigredo’s lower body is an endlessly long, winding mass extending as a 120-ft stretch of terrain. As a bonus action, he shifts up to 60 ft. of this terrain. It’s difficult terrain for others and immune to damage.

**Claimed Death.**  
Nigredo grows every time he feels responsible for a death. Every 3 claimed deaths add 30 ft. to Endless Form and grant him one extra legendary action per round (maximum 6).

**Spore Cloud Aura.**  
Creatures starting their turn within 15 ft. must succeed on a DC 22 CON save or take 4d8 necrotic damage and become diseased (disadvantage on saves, healing halved) for 1 minute.

**Sunlight Vulnerability.**  
In direct sunlight, Nigredo has disadvantage on attacks and saving throws. If reduced to 0 HP in direct sunlight, Nigredo is instantly destroyed, disintegrating into rust and rot.

## Actions

**Multiattack.**  
Nigredo makes three **Impale Drive** attacks, or two plus **Flyburst** or **Exhale the Rot**.

**Impale Drive.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 15 ft.  
Hit: 4d10 + 8 piercing plus 4d8 necrotic damage. Target makes a DC 22 STR save or is impaled, grappled, and dragged 15 ft. If already impaled, the target has vulnerability to necrotic damage until Nigredo’s next turn.

**Flyburst (Recharge 4–6).**  
Nigredo releases swarms of necrotic flies from every segment of his Endless Form.  
All creatures within 15 ft. of any part of Nigredo's body must succeed on a DC 22 CON save or take **10d8 necrotic damage** and become **blinded** until the start of their next turn. On success, creatures take half damage and avoid blindness.

**Exhale the Rot (Recharge 5–6).**  
Nigredo exhales spores in a 90-ft. cone. Creatures make a DC 22 CON save or take 12d8 necrotic damage and become diseased (disadvantage on saves, healing halved) for 1 minute.

Rotting spores fall in a 120-ft radius. Creatures make three DC 22 DEX saves with escalating effects:
