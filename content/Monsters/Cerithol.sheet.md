_When a creature within 60 ft. succeeds on a saving throw or hits with an attack roll_

## Description

A **Cerithol Lunam** is a grotesque, fleshy orb that dwells deep within the corpse-womb of the half-slain moon goddess. Blind and bulbous, it moves on five bloated intestine-like limbs and is covered in translucent, sticky mucus. When threatened, it splits open to reveal a writhing core of veins and flesh that lashes out across impossible distance. It casts spells from holes that open briefly to hiss, bleed, or scream, and its acidic blood burns like starfire.
