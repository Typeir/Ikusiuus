## Traits

**Loyal Symbiote.**  
The Lunar Kystepod is biologically tethered to Cerithol Lunami. While within 300 ft. of a Cerithol, it gains **pack tactics** and **cannot be frightened**. Additionally, the Cerithol can communicate telepathically with it.

**Lunar Chitin.**  
The Kystepod's outer shell reflects spell energy in strange ways. When the Kystepod is targeted by a damaging spell that requires a saving throw, roll a d6. On a **6**, the spell rebounds at the original caster using the same attack or save DC.

**Five-Legged Skitter.**  
The Kystepod can move across ceilings, walls, and rough surfaces without needing to make checks. Its movement ignores difficult terrain caused by organic or fleshy terrain.

## Actions

**Multiattack.**  
The Lunar Kystepod makes two attacks: either with _Chitin Claws_, with _Acidic Ventral Harpoon_, it's _Tendrils_ or it's _Held Weapons_.

**Chitin Claws.**  
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 12 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed a **DC 13 Strength saving throw** or be knocked prone.

**Acidic Ventral Harpoon.**  
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 14 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the target is already prone, it suffers **maximum acid damage**.

**Tendril**
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 16 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

## Reactions

**Spasm of Obedience.**  
_When a Cerithol Lunam within 300 ft. takes damage_:  
The Kystepod may move up to its full movement toward the Cerithol and immediately use _Chitin Claws_ if a target is within range.

## Description

**Lunar Kystepods** are bloated, five-legged insectoid aberrations resembling a grotesque blend between a cockroach and a deep-buried tick. Created through parasitic grafting and lunar ichor rituals, they serve the **Cerithol Lunam** as guardians, scouts, and blood gatherers. Though they lack higher intelligence, their instincts are perfectly tuned to the will of the Cerithol. Their shells pulse with arcane scars, and their joints leak slow trails of acidic lymph that burn wherever they step. In groups, their speed and cruelty are overwhelming.
