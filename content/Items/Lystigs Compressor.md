### **Lystig's Compressor** (Wondrous item)

- "Believe me when I say Gunpowder, Alchemical Precursors, and a metal pot is one hell of a combination. Don't ask me how, just believe me."

  - Lystig Curio, hobbit mercenary

  Forgoing a short rest, a compressor which requires 100gp in materials and proficiency with tinkers and alchemist's tools can be crafted and fitted into a gun. A gun fitted with **Lystig's Compressor** will turn into a magical object.

#### **The compressor has the following effects:**

- When it's crafted and fitted, or forgoing a short rest, the compressor can be fueled with 10gp worth of Alchemical materials in order to be able to cast cantrips along with a gunshot. Any melee spell attack component from a cantrip can be treated as a ranged attack component. Cantrips with ranged attack components can also be used. Only the gun attack has to be rolled, ignoring necessary attack rolls of other spells. If the spell incurs a saving throw, then the saving throw has to be rolled as normal, but its range is increased or decreased to that of the gun, provided they share targets or origin. If the spell has a range of self, it is ineligible, and if the range is touch, then it can be cast with the range of the weapon, provided they share targets. This feature can be used a number of times equal to the attuned creature's proficiency bonus per refuel.

- If the compressor is removed, both the gun and compressor break. The gun also has a +1 modifier to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it when using this feature.
