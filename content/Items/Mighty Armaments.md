### **Narvaez's Mighty Quiver**

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_  
_Greatsword (2d6 slashing, Heavy, Two-Handed, Special: Thrown, Graze)_

A quiver filled with **brutish, oversized greatswords**, crafted for **both melee and ranged devastation**. The quiver's enchantment allows the wielder to **hurl these blades with unnatural ease**, their trajectories crackling with residual energy.

Only **greatswords refitted for the quiver** can be used properly; **standard greatswords suffer a -5 penalty** to attack rolls unless modified (5gp & 1 hour of work by a skilled craftsman). **Magical greatswords cannot be stored in the quiver**—they are **forcefully ejected** if inserted.

#### **Weapon Mastery:**

- **Graze** – When you miss an attack with this weapon, the target still takes damage equal to your Strength modifier.

- **Mastery Ability – Thunderous Hurl (1/Short Rest, or PB/Short Rest if the wielder has mastery with Greatswords)**
  - As an **attack**, you may **hurl a greatsword** from the quiver at a target **within 30/60 ft**.
  - The blade releases a **thunderous blast**, forcing all creatures in a **5ft wide line** between you and the target to make a **Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + STR + PB)**.
  - **On failure,** they take **2d6 lightning damage**.
  - If the attack **hits**, the target takes an **additional 2d6 thunder damage** and their **speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn**.
  - **The hurled sword shatters upon impact**, becoming useless.

#### **Effects:**

- **Mighty Armament:**

  - Requires **20 Strength** or higher to wield effectively. If the requirement is not met, attacks are made at **disadvantage**.
  - Holds **up to 10 greatswords**, each weighing **6 lbs** (Quiver: **10 lbs**).
  - Drawn blades lose the **Heavy** and **Two-Handed** properties but gain **Thrown (30/60 ft) & Brittle** (breaks after impact).

- **Weapon Proficiency Override:**
  - While attuned, you **gain proficiency** with **Narvaez’s Mighty Quiver greatswords**, regardless of class.

### **Carranza's Great Épée**

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_  
_Rapier (1d8 piercing, Finesse, Special, Sap, Magical, Martial)_

A **colossal estoc** that boasts a **razor-thin but rigid blade**, designed for **both piercing strikes and parrying**. Its weight and design **allow for lethal counterattacks**, while its near-unbreakable form ensures it can parry even the strongest blows.

**Proper upkeep is required**—after **1d4+1 encounters**, if the blade is **not maintained**, it incurs a **-5 penalty to attack rolls** until restored. **Maintenance requires:**

- **10gp & 1 hour in a smithy**, or
- **8 hours of work by a proficient alchemist/tinker.**

#### **Weapon Mastery:**

- **Sap** – After hitting a creature with this weapon, their next attack roll before the start of your next turn is made at **disadvantage**.

- **Mastery Ability – Riposte Parry (1/Short Rest, or PB/Short Rest if the wielder has mastery with Rapiers)**
  - **As a reaction,** when a creature makes a melee attack against you but before the result is known, you may force them to **re-roll and take the lower result**.
  - If the attack **misses**, you may **immediately counterattack** with this weapon, dealing **an additional 1d8 lightning damage**.

#### **Effects:**

- **Mighty Armament:**

  - Requires **20 Strength** or higher to wield effectively. If the requirement is not met, attacks are made at **disadvantage**.

- **Deflecting Blade:**
  - If a **ranged attack** is made against you, you may attempt to **redirect it**. Roll a **Dexterity saving throw (DC = max(10 || DMG/2))**.
  - **On failure:** If the original attack **missed**, it is ignored. If it **hit**, you take normal damage.
  - **On success:** Choose a **new target within 30/60 ft**, rolling the attack and damage as though the original attacker had aimed for them.

### **Fatebound Fencers:**

- A creature attuned to either **Narvaez’s Mighty Quiver** or **Carranza’s Great Épée** **cannot attune to the other**.
- If the wielders of both weapons are **within 60ft of each other**, they gain the following benefits:
  - **Mighty Armament is ignored.**
  - **Narvaez’s Mighty Quiver greatswords count as 0 lbs for carrying capacity.**
  - **If the thread of fate is severed, these effects become permanent.**

---

### **Fated Demise:**

- If either wielder **falls unconscious or is slain**, the **living wielder is affected as follows**:
  - The fallen wielder’s weapon **seeks its counterpart** if within **600ft**, moving at **120ft per round** and **digging through terrain at 60ft per round** if needed.
  - The **remaining wielder automatically draws both weapons**, treating them as **light** weapons without consuming an action.
  - Gains:
    - **Advantage on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws** until unconscious.
    - **Immunity to all conditions except prone and exhaustion.**
    - **1 level of exhaustion per round.**
  - If the fallen wielder is **revived**, these effects **end**, but exhaustion remains.
  - The surviving wielder may **choose to unbind the weapons**, which:
    - **Removes all magic from the weapons** until **rebonded**.
    - **Inflicts 1 level of exhaustion** (if current exhaustion is below 3).
    - **Forces both wielders to unattune from the items.**
  - If the wielders are **more than 600ft apart**, the surviving wielder gains **1 exhaustion per day at dawn** until the bond is **severed or restored**.

#### **Carranza’s Great Épée – Deflected Fate (PB/Short Rest):**
