### **Blessed Wind**

_Longsword +3_  
_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a monk)_  
_Finesse, Versatile (1d10), Reach, Vex_

A blade forged from the very breath of the heavens, the **Blessed Wind** hums with an endless, unseen current. Those who wield it move as if guided by the storm itself, striking with a force that echoes beyond their own motion.

#### **Weapon Mastery:**

- **Vex:**

  - When you **hit a creature** with this weapon, your **next attack roll** against that creature before the end of your next turn **has advantage**.

- **Echoing Strikes:**

  - Each strike leaves behind **an afterimage**, dealing **thunder damage equal to your Wisdom modifier**.

- **Windborne Protection (PB/Day):**

  - If you **spend Ki** as part of your turn, the **Blessed Wind** emits a **protective current**, granting you **temporary hit points equal to 5 times the amount of Ki spent**.
  - This feature **can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus**, regaining all expended uses at dawn.

- **Crescent Gale (1/Short Rest, or PB/Short Rest if the wielder has mastery with Longswords):**
  - As an **action**, you unleash a **devastating, crescent-shaped slash** of wind.
  - The attack forms a **5ft wide, 60ft long line**, forcing all creatures in its path to make a **Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier)**.
  - On a **failed save**, creatures take **6d10 slashing damage** and are **pushed 10ft back**. On a **successful save**, they take half damage and are not pushed. This attack deals double damage to constructs and inanimate objects.
