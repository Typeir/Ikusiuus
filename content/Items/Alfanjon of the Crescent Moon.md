# Alfanjón of the Crescent Moon

_Curved longsword (Finesse Longsword / Curved Greatsword) +1_  
_Very rare (requires attunement)_  
_Weapon (Melee, Finesse, Versatile, Mastery: Slow)_  
_Can be used as a spellcasting focus_

Forged from a sliver of condensed moonlight and the scale of a lunar wyrm, this crescent blade phases gently in and out of visibility, humming faintly under the stars. Its form is tailored for agile swordmasters whose grace intertwines with arcane instinct.

## Weapon Mastery

- **Slow**: On hit, the target’s movement speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

- **Mooncleave** _(1/Short rest, or 3/Short rest if the wielder has mastery with Longswords)_:  
  As an action, sweep the blade in a great lunar arc:
  - All creatures in a **30-foot cone** must make a **Dexterity saving throw (DC = Spell Save DC + 1)**
  - **Failure**: 3d8 cold + 3d8 force damage
  - **Success**: Half damage
