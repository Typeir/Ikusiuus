## 📖 **Session Recap**  

The party **returned to Dhanas** to descend back into the **Sunken City**, using a **lift system** constructed by the returning townsfolk. Along the way, they noticed that **Lacuna displayed unusual dexterity and intelligence**, subtly **stopping Lystig from cutting the lift rope**.  

Before setting off, **Sigus visited Nuria**, an old friend who had once smuggled him into Borossa. Now a seasoned illegal fisher, Nuria gifted Sigus **cold protection wands**, explaining that she no longer needed them, as she had grown accustomed to the **frigid waters of the Borossan coast**.  

Upon reaching the ruins, the party encountered **the Lobster-Men**, who were seemingly **guarding** the entrance to deeper areas. A **failed stealth attempt led to combat**, and the party **fought their way through**.  

Progressing further into the ruins, they found **ancient Colonial Hidden architecture**, indicating that the **Sunken City** was built **atop the Empyrean Thalassian tunnels**. After navigating the **maze-like structures**, the party reached a **massive chasm**, where a **faint golden light** illuminated **what seemed to be a city far below**.
