# Albedo's Curse Effects Table (Fractal and Crustacean Variants)

| **d100 Roll** | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01-05         | **Bone Sprawl**: Bones begin to grow uncontrollably, forming twisted protrusions under the skin. The investigator permanently loses 1 point of **DEX** and suffers a **Sanity loss of 1d6** each day until treated. Movement is agonizing, and any physical roll requires an **Extreme success**.                                                   |
| 06-10         | **Chitinous Carapace**: Hard, shell-like plates begin forming along the investigator’s back and limbs, creating a rough carapace. This decreases their **DEX by 10**, requires **Extreme success** on physical rolls, and causes **Sanity loss of 2d6** every time a new patch of chitin forms, as movement grows increasingly restricted.          |
| 11-20         | **Endless Fingers**: One of the investigator’s fingers begins to grow fractal-like, with smaller fingers splitting off at its tip, twitching independently. This incurs a **-20 penalty** to all actions using that hand, and the investigator loses **1d4 Sanity** each day they witness the growth.                                               |
| 21-25         | **Shrimp Pincer Growth**: One of the investigator’s fingers transforms into a small, shrimp-like pincer that involuntarily snaps shut when agitated. The pincer imposes a **-20 penalty** to all actions using that hand, and the investigator loses **1d4 Sanity** each time they see or use it, feeling disturbed by its uncontrollable snapping. |
| 26-30         | **Fractal Eyes**: New eyes appear around one of the investigator’s existing eyes, blinking in random patterns. This grants **+10 to Spot Hidden rolls** but incurs a **Sanity loss of 2d6** whenever the investigator sees their reflection.                                                                                                        |
| 31-35         | **Stalked Eye**: One of the investigator’s eyes begins to extend outward on a thin, stalk-like growth, resembling the eyes of a crab. While it grants **+10 to Spot Hidden rolls**, social interactions become unsettling for others, and the investigator loses **2d6 Sanity** upon discovering the stalk.                                         |
| 36-40         | **Pupil Proliferation**: Pupils multiply across the whites of the investigator’s eyes, forming a dark, fractal-like pattern that disrupts vision. This imposes a **Hard difficulty** on Perception rolls and causes a **Sanity loss of 1d6** when discovered.                                                                                       |
| 41-45         | **Compound Eyes**: The investigator’s eyes transform, developing a compound structure that causes blurred, segmented vision similar to that of crustaceans. Perception rolls are now **Hard**, and the investigator loses **1d6 Sanity** upon realizing the change.                                                                                 |
| 46-50         | **Branching Nails**: Fingernails split into smaller, translucent layers, fractally multiplying into claw-like growths that bleed when clipped. The investigator takes **1 HP damage** per day due to bleeding and suffers **1d4 Sanity loss** each day they see the growth. Fine motor tasks using the hands incur a **-20 penalty**.               |
| 51-55         | **Crusty Claws**: Fingernails thicken and harden into crustacean-like claws, with jagged edges that painfully scrape objects. Each day they handle something solid, they take **1 HP damage** and a **Sanity loss of 1d4** due to the painful growth. Fine motor tasks have a **-20 penalty**.                                                      |
| 56-60         | **Jaw Unhinged**: The investigator’s jaw begins developing additional, fractal-like hinges, giving them a grotesque appearance. Speaking and eating are painful, imposing a **-20 penalty** on social rolls, with an initial **Sanity loss of 1d6** upon discovery.                                                                                 |
| 61-65         | **Mandibles of Albedo**: The investigator’s jaw mutates, forming hard, mandible-like extensions reminiscent of crustaceans. These mandibles impair speech and impose a **-20 penalty** on social rolls. Upon discovering the change, the investigator suffers a **Sanity loss of 2d6**.                                                             |
| 66-70         | **Tooth Multiplication**: Additional teeth grow within the investigator’s cheeks, forming sharp, fractal-like rows. The investigator takes **1 HP damage daily** as the extra teeth tear at the mouth, and they experience a **Sanity loss of 1d6** when eating solid food.                                                                         |
| 71-75         | **Feeding Mouthparts**: Small, serrated mouthparts form on the insides of the investigator’s cheeks, similar to a shrimp's feeding mandibles. The investigator suffers **1 HP damage daily** and **Sanity loss of 1d6** whenever they attempt to eat solid food, as the mouthparts tear at their inner cheeks.                                      |
| 76-80         | **Fractal Lashes**: Eyelashes grow uncontrollably, forming dense clusters that partially obstruct vision. All visual Perception rolls are now **Hard**, and **1d4 Sanity** is lost each day if not trimmed or concealed.                                                                                                                            |
| 81-85         | **Chitinous Eyelids**: The investigator’s eyelids harden and darken, taking on a shell-like texture. All Perception rolls are **Hard** due to restricted blinking, and each time they see their eyelids or touch them, they take **1d4 Sanity loss** as the unnatural feeling unnerves them.                                                        |
| 86-90         | **Webbed Skin**: Thin, translucent webs form across the investigator’s joints, restricting movement and causing all DEX-based rolls to be **Hard**. The investigator suffers **1d4 Sanity loss** upon discovering the webs.                                                                                                                         |
| 91-95         | **Shell Patches**: Rough, shell-like patches grow across the investigator’s joints, limiting flexibility and requiring all DEX-based rolls to be **Hard**. The shell fragments cause **1d4 Sanity loss** each day as the investigator feels increasingly restricted.                                                                                |
| 96-100        | **Fractal Hair**: Hair grows in fractal clusters, splitting into smaller strands, giving an unsettling appearance. This imposes a **-10 penalty** to social interactions but does not induce further Sanity loss.                                                                                                                                   |
| 101+          | **Crab-Like Antennae**: The investigator grows thin, antenna-like hairs that twitch and sense nearby movement. While disturbing to look at, they do not impair function. The investigator suffers an initial **1d4 Sanity loss** upon discovery but gains no further penalty.                                                                       |
