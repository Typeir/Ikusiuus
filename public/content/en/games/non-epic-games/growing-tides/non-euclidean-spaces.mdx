# Eternal Growth Spaces

## (1) The Endless Pool Rooms

- ### a

  - The investigators find themselves in a seemingly abandoned, labyrinthine series of **pools and tiled rooms**. The air is warm and damp, with faint echoes of dripping water reverberating in the endless chambers. The tiled floors are slick, patterned in white and pale blue, and fogged mirrors line the walls sporadically. Water seeps out from the grout in the tiles, forming tiny, still pools on the floor.

- ### b

  - The pools are shallow, but each room varies slightly in depth and width, giving a disorienting feeling as if each step might plunge them into deeper waters. Occasionally, they glimpse **white fractal growths** extending from the walls and into the pools, creating a web of algae-like tendrils that float just below the surface.

  - When investigators peer into the pools, they must succeed in a **Sanity roll** (2/2d6 loss) as they see distorted reflections of themselves that appear to have additional limbs, elongated faces, or eyes with multiple pupils.

- ### c

  - As they move further, they encounter an endless series of **rusted restroom stalls** lining the walls, with each door slightly ajar. Within each stall, they may find strange things: a pair of old boots, a soaked notebook, or even a reflection of themselves standing in the stall. If an investigator sees their own reflection, they must make a **Hard INT roll** to avoid a **1d4 Sanity loss**. Upon failing, they may feel an irresistible urge to follow the reflection’s gaze, becoming more disoriented in the maze-like pools.

  - Every time they turn back, the pools and stalls seem rearranged, subtly shifting behind them. If they attempt to retrace their steps, they will instead find themselves walking in circles unless they succeed on a **Navigate roll** (Hard if they have already failed twice).

## (2) The Twisting Halls

- ### a

  - The investigators step into a never-ending series of **metallic hallways**, each one appearing identical to the last. The lighting flickers erratically, casting long shadows that stretch and warp along the walls. The walls themselves seem to pulse with a faint, organic rhythm, as if alive, with fractal white veins threading through the metal.

- ### b

  - Periodically, they pass open doorways that lead to identical halls or into empty rooms that seem to serve no purpose. The doors slam shut when approached, only to slowly creak open again if they try to move on. The investigators may see **distorted, shadowy figures** at the ends of some hallways, but these vanish if pursued, leaving them to question whether they were ever real.

  - The further they venture, the more the hallways distort, narrowing or broadening at random. Some sections slope sharply, while others are perfectly level, creating a nauseating sense of vertigo. The investigators must make a **CON roll** (Hard if they have been inside the halls for more than 10 minutes) to avoid feeling dizzy and disoriented, with failure causing a **Sanity loss of 1d4**.

- ### c

  - Strange, alien **symbols** appear on some walls, etched in a faint, white substance. If an investigator attempts to decipher them, they must make an **Occult roll**. A success provides them with an intuitive understanding that the symbols refer to “passage,” “traps,” or “sealing,” hinting at Albedo’s spatial manipulations. Failure, however, increases their **Sanity loss by 1d4** as the symbols start to pulse, almost as if watching them.

  - A **Spot Hidden roll** allows the investigators to discover a peculiar marking: a line of white fractal growth that seems to “loop” through the hallways, possibly offering a means to escape. However, it can only be followed if they succeed on a **Navigate roll** to resist the spatial distortions.

## (3) The Fractured Underwater Railings

- ### a

  - The investigators find themselves on a set of submerged **metal railings**, suspended in water that seems both shallow and endless. The railings stretch out in multiple directions, some leading upward and others spiraling downward into the murky depths, twisting in impossible angles and overlapping with one another.

- ### b

  - Small, luminescent white fractals are scattered across the metal railings, shedding a faint glow that provides minimal visibility. As they advance, they notice **tendril-like growths** reaching up from the seafloor, attaching themselves to the railings in complex, fractal patterns.

  - Occasionally, bubbles escape from the tendrils, floating upward and bursting with a sound like distant whispers. Any investigator who listens to these whispers must make a **Sanity roll** (2/2d6 loss) as the voices seem to echo personal fears or secrets that no one else could know.

- ### c

  - The railings loop back on themselves in nonsensical ways, leading the investigators in circles. If they attempt to descend toward the depths, they notice the fractal tendrils grow thicker and more pervasive, and they must make **CON rolls** against the increasing water pressure. Failing the roll results in **1 HP of damage per minute** due to the crushing force.

  - Occasionally, the investigators glimpse **shrimp-like creatures** darting through the water, larger than any natural species. The creatures have spindly limbs and many eyes, watching them from a distance. If approached, the creatures scatter, only to reappear a short distance away, stalking the investigators as they traverse the railings.

  - At one point, they will see the distorted reflection of a door in the surface of the water beneath them. Attempting to reach this door requires a successful **Swim roll** and a **Hard INT roll** to resist the disorienting pressure. Failing either roll results in the investigator feeling as if they are **pulled deeper into the dark water**, with a **Sanity loss of 1d6** as they momentarily glimpse Albedo’s pulsating form waiting below in the chasm.
