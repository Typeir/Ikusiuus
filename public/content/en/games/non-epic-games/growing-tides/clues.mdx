# Clues

---

## (1) The Observation Deck

- ### a

  - **Some Cartographers tools** seem to trace a route to a few demi-islands around the rig, but these islands are not shown on the official maps.

  - **A telescope** can be found nearby, apparently pointing in the direction of these islands, but when the investigator uses it, a white, tumorous crab emerges from the lenses and attacks the investigator. The investigator must succeed on a Hard DEX roll or be startled and be considered outnumbered to the crab.
    Additionally, they must make a **Sanity roll** (2/2d6) to check wether they notice the disturbing nature of the creature.

- ### b

  - **An old map of drill routes** is behind the one pinned to the wall. A **Spot Hidden roll** reveals faintly traced lines extending deeper beneath the seabed than standard protocol dictates.

---

## (2) The Lower Storage Room

- ### a

  - An unsettling **collection of empty fuel barrels** are stacked along one wall, coated with an odd white substance that pulses faintly. This pulsing is barely noticeable without a **Spot Hidden roll** but induces nausea if watched for too long.

- ### b

  - Among the barrels lies a **scrap of clothing** belonging to **[THE MISSING WORKER]**. It's damp and covered in strange white veins. Anyone touching it must make a **CON roll** to avoid brief vertigo and a vision of being submerged in an endless, blank-white ocean, and contract **Albedo's curse** in the next hour.

- ### c

  - Among the inventory, there seems to be something missing. An **Extreme Spott Hidden** roll will have the investigator realize that a high-pressure vibranium cutter is missing.

---

## (3) The Pump Room

- ### a

  - The machinery hums with abnormal intensity, as if under great strain. One of the gauges reads far above normal levels, and a **Mechanical Repair roll** indicates that it’s being fed power from an unknown source. If the mechanical Repair roll fails, the pressure gauge explodes, dealing 2d10 damage to the investigator.

- ### b

  - A faint **rustling noise** can be heard, echoing from a hatch below the main pump. Listening closely, a **Hard Listen roll** allows one to hear a low, rhythmic drumming sound, as if something massive is shifting in the depths below.

---

## (4) The Galley

- ### a

  - A foul-smelling **dish covered in fine white dust** is left on one of the tables. A **Chemistry or Natural World roll** reveals the powder as altered fossil fuel. If consumed, the dish imparts visions of fractal growths on the eater’s own body (Sanity Loss: 2/2d10).

- ### b

  - A **crumpled note** on the countertop reads: “Our work here is necessary. Albedo’s will must come to pass.” A **Hard Psychology roll** will reveal that the handwriting seems hastily disguised, as if to conceal the writer’s true identity.

---

## (5) The Drill Control Room

- ### a

  - The room feels oppressively warm, with the drill vibrating as though struggling to bore through an impossibly dense material. A **Geology or Mechanical Repair roll** identifies this depth as unprecedented, possibly near a natural barrier of unknown origin.

- ### b

  - The **depth gauge** flashes with an error message. A **Mechanical Repair roll** reveals that the drill is penetrating a layer likely marking the site of Thealas, the Empyrean capital.

---

## (6) The Lower Bathysphere Docks

- ### a

  - The **bathyspheres** are coated in white fractal growths, almost like veins. A **Biology or Natural World roll** reveals they are inorganic but grow in an endlessly replicating fractal pattern.

- ### b

  - A strange **underwater map** is pinned to the wall, with markings leading directly to an underwater chasm near the drill’s current location. A **Spot Hidden roll** uncovers a secondary note scratched into the map:

---

## (7) Petrocles’s Office

- ### a

  - On his desk, a **tattered journal page** is marked with the words: “They call to me. O, Primordial Growth, I answer your beckons.” If read aloud, the reader must make a **Sanity roll** (2/2d6) as visions of countless white, prying eyes fill their mind.

- ### b

  - **Drilling schematics** show that Petrocles has overridden protocol, pushing plans further down toward the ocean floor than regulations allow. A **Library Use or Spot Hidden roll** reveals an ancient symbol resembling an Empyrean seal, akin to those found near the seawater reservoirs of the province of Antumbra.

---

## (8) [THE MISSING WORKER]'s Quarters

- ### a

  - **Drawings of a crab-like entity** are scattered around the bunk. The creature’s eyes are sketched with a disconcerting warmth, but its many limbs and claws are unnervingly sharp. A **Spot Hidden roll** reveals more sketches under the mattress, showing the figure crushing humanoid forms in its pincers.

- ### b

  - A **note scrawled on the wall** reads: “They see, they care, and they’ll bring us all home soon.” The phrase instills a deep sense of dread, prompting anyone who reads it to make a **Hard INT roll** to resist an unsettling kinship with the message. If the investigator fails the roll, they will receive a penalty die to every roll made against Albedo.

---

## (9) The Maintenance Corridor

- ### a

  - The corridor walls are covered in thin layers of **white fractal veins** that occasionally pulsate. Anyone touching the growth must make a **CON roll** or feel a painful, crawling sensation beneath their skin, as if countless tiny limbs are burrowing through their flesh, and contract **Albedo's curse** in the next hour.

- ### b

  - A faint **rumbling** reverberates from beyond the walls, as if something massive is shifting far below the rig. A **Listen roll** confirms that the sound is coming from the depths of the drill shaft.

---

## (11) The Maintenance Room

- ### a

  - In the dimly lit Maintenance Room, the **drill release control** emits a faint, pulsating white glow, its casing slightly cracked and humming ominously. Anyone succeeding on a **Spot Hidden roll** will notice the control seems unusually swollen, as though something inside is pressing outward.

  - When an investigator approaches or interacts with the control, it suddenly **bursts open** with a loud hiss, and a **serpentine, shrimp-like creature** slithers out, writhing and undulating as it emerges. All investigators witnessing this must make a **Sanity roll** (3/3d6 loss) due to its unsettling, fractal-like appearance and movement.

  - The creature will quickly **latch onto the nearest investigator**, attempting to wrap its segmented body around them and pull them toward the jagged, broken machinery. The investigator must make a **DEX or STR roll** to break free. Failing this roll results in the creature drawing them closer to the control mechanism, where they face _instant death_ if fully pulled inside.

  - _Surviving the grapple:_ If an investigator escapes the grapple, the shrimp-creature will scuttle back into the broken machine, its limbs vanishing into an impossible fractal pattern within the dark opening. Any investigator who made physical contact with the creature and survived must make a **CON roll** to avoid becoming afflicted by **Albedo's curse**: an ongoing sensation of tightness and fractal growth beneath the skin, resulting in a **2/2d6 Sanity loss each day** until cured.

  - The **drill release control** remains damaged beyond repair after this incident, sparking and emitting a foul-smelling vapor.

---

- ### b

  - Nearby, a discarded **scuba suit** stands upright in the shadows, as if supported by an invisible force. If approached, investigators will see the suit is filled with **tiny, pale shrimp**, endlessly writhing inside its transparent helmet.

  - The suit moves in short, jerky steps, occasionally stumbling, but otherwise appears _harmless_. If interacted with, the suit will make no aggressive movements but will follow the nearest investigator at a slow pace, maintaining a constant five-foot distance. Anyone observing the suit for prolonged periods must make a **Sanity roll** (2/2d6 loss) as the sight of it becomes increasingly disturbing.

  - If ignored or left alone, the suit eventually settles into a corner of the room, the shrimp within continuing to wriggle in eerie silence.

## (12) The Underwater Railings

- ### a

  - As the investigators descend the narrow metal stairs to reach the underwater railings, flickering lights cast shifting shadows across the seafloor. The railings are encrusted with patches of the same white fractal growths seen elsewhere in the rig, faintly pulsating like slow, heavy breaths. A successful **Spot Hidden roll** will reveal small shrimp-like creatures wriggling in the cracks of the railings, retreating quickly if approached.

- ### b

  - Halfway along the railings, a **distant, rhythmic scraping sound** begins to echo through the water. An investigator making a **Listen roll** will recognize the unmistakable sound of a high-pressure vibranium cutter activating and shutting off. Those failing the roll feel an overwhelming sense of lurking danger, causing a **1d4 Sanity loss** as the unnatural vibrations fill the air.

- ### c

  - As they continue, an unsettling figure appears in the dim light from the rig: a **twisted, shrimp-like creature**, far larger than those they’ve seen, lumbers into view. In its many twitching limbs, it clutches the missing **high-pressure vibranium cutter**, its edges glowing faintly with a dangerous hum. When the creature spots the investigators, it brandishes the cutter with unnatural skill, slicing through railing and equipment with ease as it rushes toward them, intent on a chase.

- ### d

  - **The Chase Begins**:

    - The investigators must flee down the narrow railing to escape the monster’s rapid advances. The path back to safety requires them to make a series of **DEX rolls** to avoid slipping on the slick algae, dodging the creature’s wild swipes with the vibranium cutter. Failure on any **DEX roll** results in the investigator stumbling or falling, losing ground and incurring **1d6 damage** as debris flies up from the creature’s relentless attacks.

    - Every second round, the creature uses the vibranium cutter to make a wide, sweeping cut across the railing, dealing **2d6 slashing damage** to any investigator who fails a **DEX roll** to duck or evade the swing.

- ### e

  - **Diverging Paths**:

    - Halfway through the chase, the railing splits into two narrow paths. The left side leads further down toward the chasm entrance, while the right curves back up toward the rig’s submerged maintenance area. An investigator succeeding on a **Hard INT roll** will sense the right path leads to a safer but longer route. The left path is shorter but slopes dangerously down into the unknown depths.

    - Choosing the left path requires **Extreme DEX rolls** due to its slippery, steep incline. Failure results in a **1d8 damage fall** and forces investigators to rejoin the right path. If all investigators reach the right path, they may briefly outpace the creature.

- ### f

  - **The Final Stretch**:

    - As the investigators near the maintenance hatch back to the rig, the creature takes one last, frantic swing with the cutter, striking a pipe along the railing. This sends a surge of scalding water jetting across the passage, requiring a final **DEX roll** to avoid the burning spray. Investigators who fail take **2d6 heat damage** and are temporarily blinded, adding a **-20 penalty** to any further actions in the chase.

    - If the investigators succeed in escaping through the hatch, they hear the creature’s frustrated, metallic grinding as it slashes wildly at the closed door, finally retreating when the cutter’s charge flickers and dies.

- ### g

  - **Aftermath**:

    - If any investigator touched the creature or was hit by water tainted by its growths, they must roll a **CON save** to avoid contracting **Albedo’s curse**. The investigators suffer an additional **Sanity loss of 1d6** due to the close encounter with the strange, relentless entity, realizing the depth of Albedo's influence in their surroundings.

## (13) The Underwater Chasm

- ### a

  - At the deepest point of the chasm, the drill has breached a delicate seal, exposing a cavern lined with pulsating white fractal patterns. Anyone observing the space must make a **Hard Sanity roll** (2/2d6 loss) as they feel an unnatural compulsion to enter.

- ### b

  - Moving closer reveals **Albedo**, an enormous, crab-like entity with limbs that fracture into delicate fractals, each white claw reflecting endless iterations of nearby shapes. Despite Albedo’s disquieting appearance, they emanate an air of strange tenderness. Witnessing Albedo closely requires a hard **Sanity roll** (6/6d10).

- ### c

  - Albedo may speak directly to investigators, their voice both unsettling and oddly gentle, offering to “embrace” them as part of their world. The sound compels all who hear it to make a **Hard INT roll** or feel an overwhelming urge to draw closer. Those who fail are entranced, believing Albedo’s “embrace” to be a merciful act, but it is fatal.

  - Any survivors who flee the chasm or escape Albedo’s influence must make a final **Sanity roll** (10/10d10) as visions of fractal limbs and watchful, caring eyes haunt them long after the encounter.
