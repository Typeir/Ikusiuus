| 1        | **Travelling Merchant**: A travelling merchant with a curious moon-shaped mask shows up. He offers a **white light torch** and a **sword with a crescent moon hilt** in exchange for shelter. If he is offered food, and the food is blighted, he will reappear as a **ghoul** in the final encounter. |
| 2        | **Blighted Mandrake**: A lone blighted mandrake attacks the Investigator closest to the secondary pantry. This creature has a hanging fruit. The fruit heals blight if consumed, but it drains 4/3d6 Sanity.                                                                                           |
| 3-5      | **Rainstorm**: A rainstorm starts. Outdoor terrain becomes slippery, requiring successful **DEX** rolls to sprint through safely. Sounds become muffled from room to room, heightening tension and confusion.                                                                                          |
| 6        | **Pack of Deer**: A pack of deer gets into the property, trampling crops and breaking objects. The Investigators spend 2d4 15-minute intervals clearing the mess up.                                                                                                                                   |
| 7        | **Falling Tree**: The centerpiece tree collapses onto the barracks. Any Investigator inside must succeed on a **Hard DEX roll** or take 3d6 damage from the falling debris.                                                                                                                            |
| 8        | **Bandits**: A group of 3 bandits shows up, demanding entry and all the goods and valuables inside. If led into **Nigredo's** lair, they will sign a contract with him and become blighted. They will reappear as enemies in a subsequent encounter.                                                   |
| 9        | **Gnome**: A gnome slips through the rift. If the door is not open, it will hide until it is, waiting for the right moment to cause mischief or reveal itself.                                                                                                                                         |
| 10       | **Massive Landshark**: A **massive landshark** suddenly burrows up from the ground into the property, creating chaos and terror. The landshark is a territorial herbivore. It has the following features:                                                                                              |
