# THE APOTHECARY - LORE

_For a while now, your ointments, pills, beverages, and medicines have begun rotting at preposterous paces.
The wooden tools you use are infested with termites, and no matter how many times you replace them, they rarely last
more than two nights. You've seen the rotten creatures that live in the wood scurry into the lower chambers, but you don't
have a key. There is something weird about the critters, but your grasp on insectoid anatomy is not great. You have been
dissecting a few bees from the keep here and there to try and understand what's going on. Your black iron scalpel has gone missing._
