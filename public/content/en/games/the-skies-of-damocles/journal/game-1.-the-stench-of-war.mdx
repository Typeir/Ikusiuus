## 📖 **Session Recap**

The party—each a stranger to the other—was recruited as **mercenaries in service to the Borossan monarchy**, assigned to **defend their homeland** against the **Brumean invasion**. Their first mission was simple: **reinforce the northern front**, ensuring no Brumean forces made it past the mountains and onto Borossan soil.

At the **mountain’s edge**, they fought off a **Brumean patrol**, **rifle-armed but otherwise unremarkable**. After a brief skirmish, they continued their march toward the beaches.

Their next battle took place at an **old mill**, where **a larger Brumean force** had dug in. Though **better equipped and more numerous**, the defenders were no match for the **party’s brutal efficiency**. Niccolo **killed the enemy leader instantly with a perfect shot**, Sigus **sent two men screaming into the sawblades**, and Lystig **set fire to the structure**, turning it into a smouldering ruin.

Yet the **real horror** came afterward.

A **foul stench** carried on the wind. The **air itself warped** as something **unnatural** approached. Then came the **crepitation**—a sound that set the **party’s nerves on edge**, like **insects burrowing beneath their skin**.

Then it emerged—a **Golden Clasper**.

The **Brumeans had somehow unleashed this thing**—a **massive crustacean**, fused with **sickly human limbs**, scuttling forward with an almost **mindless hunger**. It fought **not like a trained war-beast**, but as **something barely restrained**, driven forward by the vague commands of its handlers.

The battle was **brutal**. The **Golden Clasper’s chitin resisted their strikes**, and its **massive claws** threatened to **tear them apart**. But through coordinated effort, they **felled the beast**—though not without scars.

As the **creature convulsed in its final moments**, Sigus felt **something stir inside him**. There was **an inexplicable familiarity**—not recognition, but a **deep, nauseating certainty** that **this thing was connected to him**.

To his **blood**.

To his **father**.
