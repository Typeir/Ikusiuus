# Character Progression in Damocles

Along their travels through the lands of Damocles and beyond, characters will grow— not just in strength, but in complexity. To live is to change, and to change is to live.

Wielding power in Damocles leaves marks: scars from wielding magicks, forbidden knowledge stolen from ruins, strange skills learned at knife’s edge, or pacts whispered under ruined moons. These changes are not always clean or comfortable, but they are real.

As characters progress, they advance through their **classes**, gain new **features**, and acquire **feats** that represent the lessons, failings, wounds and changes forged during play.

_No one leaves a life of violence and wonder unchanged_.

## Leveling Up, Standard Play

- Characters gain **experience points** (XP) per encounter, as determined by the GM and the appropiate calculations if combat occurs. **Milestone leveling** is not contemplated for Damocles.
- On leveling up, characters increase their **class level**, gaining new features, spells, hit points, and abilities according to their chosen class.
- **Proficiency bonus increases** at specific levels as normal:

| XP Total | Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| -------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| 0        | 1     | +2                |
| 300      | 2     | +2                |
| 900      | 3     | +2                |
| 2,700    | 4     | +2                |
| 6,500    | 5     | +3                |
| 14,000   | 6     | +3                |
| 23,000   | 7     | +3                |
| 34,000   | 8     | +3                |
| 48,000   | 9     | +4                |
| 64,000   | 10    | +4                |
| 85,000   | 11    | +4                |
| 100,000  | 12    | +4                |
| 120,000  | 13    | +5                |
| 140,000  | 14    | +5                |
| 165,000  | 15    | +5                |
| 195,000  | 16    | +5                |
| 225,000  | 17    | +6                |
| 265,000  | 18    | +6                |
| 305,000  | 19    | +6                |
| 355,000  | 20    | +6                |

## Multiclassing

Multiclassing is allowed in Damocles and follows the standard 5E rules:

- A character may choose to take levels in another class when they level up, provided they meet the prerequisites.
- **Hit points, features, spells, and abilities stack** according to the multiclassing rules in the Player’s Handbook.
- **Narrative justification is required**.
  - Multiclassing must reflect the character's actual experiences or development.
  - For example, a fighter becoming a wizard must have studied under someone or discovered relevant knowledge; a wizard becoming a barbarian might reflect a bodily or mental shift from trauma, possession, or revelation.

## Feats and Tier Progression

In Damocles, the **tiers of play** represent not just mechanical breakpoints but narrative growth. To reflect this:

### Additional Feats at Tier Transitions

Whenever a character **enters a new tier of play**, they gain an **extra feat**. This is in addition to any feats gained through normal ability score improvements (ASIs).

#### Tiers and Feat Gains:

| Tier       | Level Range | Feat Gained  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **Tier 2** | Level 5     | 1 extra feat |
| **Tier 3** | Level 9     | 1 extra feat |
| **Tier 4** | Level 13    | 1 extra feat |
| **Tier 5** | Level 17    | 1 extra feat |

Additionally, upon reaching **Level 20**, a character gains an epic boon.

---

### Feat Restrictions

- The choice of feat **must remain consistent with the character’s nature, history, and the world of Damocles**.
- Feats that are **impossible, implausible, or lore-breaking** are not allowed.
- For example, no **Pieni** may take a dragon-marked feat, and no **human** may claim knowledge of long-dead dwarven lineages or powers.

---

### GM Enforcement

- The GM has final say on whether a feat choice is **plausible and consistent**.
- Players are encouraged to explain how their character gained access to the new feat— through training, discovery, battle, or transformation.
- The **feat should reflect the narrative**, not just mechanics.

---

## Epic Progression: Beyond Level 20

Most lives end before this point.  
But a select few have been fated to become more, or have shed their fate to **be** more.

In Damocles, by default, **normal play extends to level 30**.  
Progression through these levels represents a shift in the dynamics of the world, the character becomes a god-candidate.
The hardships the character face or cause **should** represent that.

No class extends above level 20, and no attempt at extending them will be made, to reach level 30 is to become **more** than a mere wizard or warrior.

### Notes on Epic Progression

- **Proficiency bonus continues to scale**, capping at **+9** at level 30.
- Players may gain additional **feats, features, or epic boons** at the GM’s discretion.
- The GM is encouraged to alter reality accordingly. Players at this level may start to break the setting— this is intentional.
