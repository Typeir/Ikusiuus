## Traits

**Fungal Engineered Core.**  
The Ventralis variant is considered both a Construct and Undead. It can be affected by effects that target either.

**Spore Exhalation (Recharge 5–6).**  
Immediately after moving at least 10 ft., the Hunter emits fungal clouds into a **10-ft radius** centered on itself. Creatures in the area must make a **DC 18 Constitution saving throw** or be **infected** and **blinded** until the end of their next turn. This area becomes **difficult terrain** for 1 minute as the floor blooms with creeping mycelium.

**Fungal Spellcasting.**  
After completing its movement, the Hunter may cast one of the following spells as a bonus action, centered on itself or its space:

- _Grease_ (DC 18 Dex)
- _Web_ (DC 18 Dex, restrained on failure)
- _Stinking Cloud_ (DC 18 Con, poisoned and can't take actions)
- _Entangle_ (DC 18 Str)

Each spell can be used **once per day**, or cast again by expending spell points.

**Spell Point Reserve.**  
The Hunter has **8 spell points** to recast any of its fungal spells. It cannot use spell points for other spells.

## Actions

**Multiattack.**  
The Hunter makes one attack with its Fated Blade and one with its Particle Renders or Thruster Axe-Kick.

**Fated Blade** _(Melee Weapon, Finesse)_  
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 2d10 + 6 slashing damage  
**Effect**: Once per day per creature, the target must succeed on a **DC 20 Charisma saving throw** or become **vulnerable to all damage** from this blade. The Hunter also gains **truesight** on that target for 1 minute.

**Particle Renders** _(Melee Weapon, One-Handed)_  
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 2d8 + 6 slashing damage  
**Effect**: After a successful hit, the Hunter may make one additional free attack with this weapon (does not stack).

**Thruster Axe-Kick** _(Gap Closer)_  
_Special Melee Weapon Attack_: +11 to hit, range 10–30 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 3d10 + 6 slashing damage  
**Effect**: Target must succeed on a **DC 18 Strength saving throw** or be knocked prone.  
If the target takes damage, it catches fire.

## Infection Mechanic

**Ventralis Infection.**  
Any creature hit by a melee weapon attack must succeed on a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw** or become **infected** with a latent fungal curse.

While infected:

- The creature has **disadvantage on death saving throws**.
- If the creature dies, it **rises as a fungal zombie** in 1 minute (use Ghoul or Tombsteel Husk stat block).
- Magical healing restores HP normally, but does **not** remove the infection.
- _Remove Curse_, _Greater Restoration_, or _Wish_ can cure it.
- \*After a fullday infected, the character must roll on the **Curse of Nigredo** Table.

> The infection is magical and demonic in origin. It cannot be cured by mundane means.

## Coatings

All Ventralis Hunter weapons are coated in necrotic mycelium. Once per day per creature, on hit, the target must make a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw** or suffer one of the following conditions (Hunter’s choice):

- Sleep
- Paralysis
- Poisoned
- Frightened

> The **Fated Blade’s** special vulnerability effect can only be attempted **once per day per target**.
