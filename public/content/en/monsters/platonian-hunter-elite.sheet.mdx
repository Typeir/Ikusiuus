## Actions

**Multiattack.**  
The Platonian Hunter makes one attack with its main weapon and two attacks with its Fated Blade, or two attacks with any weapon, plus an attack with a Disambiguator, if it has one available.

**Muon Blaster** _(Ranged Weapon, Two-Handed)_  
_Ranged Weapon Attack_: +13 to hit, range 120/300 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 4d12 + 8 force damage

**Fated Blade** _(Melee Weapon, Finesse, One-Handed)_  
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 2d10 + 7 slashing damage  
**Effect**: Once per day per creature, the target must succeed on a **DC 20 Charisma saving throw** or become **vulnerable to all damage** from this blade. The Hunter also gains **truesight** on that target for 1 minute. Additionally, the target loses all magic effects currently affecting it, such as _bless_ or _haste_.

**Particle Renders** _(Melee Weapon, One-Handed)_  
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 2d8 + 7 slashing damage  
**Effect**: After a successful hit, the Hunter may make one additional free attack with this weapon. This extra attack does not stack.

**Disambiguator** _(Melee Weapon, One-Handed, recharge 4-6)_
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 2d6 + 9 slashing damage, 2d12 necrotic damage.
The plationian hunter choses an effect from the following list after it hits:

- **Effect, the Toll**: The target must roll a DC 20 Constituion saving throw, or fail a death saving throw. Additionally, the target loses all magic effects currently affecting it, such as _bless_ or _haste_.
- **Effect, the Cave**: The target must roll a DC 18 charisma saving throw or be Stunned, Paralyzed, Put to Sleep and Petrified (Petrification takes two full rounds to take effect). The target cannot repeat this saving throw and can only be cured with curse removal.

The hunter heals half of the damage dealt with this attack.

**Thruster Axe-Kick (Gap Closer).**  
_Special Melee Weapon Attack_: +12 to hit, range 10–30 ft., one target.  
The Hunter launches forward on hydraulic thrusters, kicking with its bladed limb, it lands on an unoccupied space 5ft away from it's target.  
**Hit**: 3d10 + 7 slashing damage  
**Effect**: If the target is Large or smaller, it must make a **DC 18 Strength saving throw** or be knocked prone.  
If the target takes damage from this attack, it **catches fire** (see below).

> **On Fire**: While on fire, the target takes **1d6 fire damage** at the start of each of its turns. A creature can use its action to extinguish the flames, or automatically extinguish them by being submerged in water.
