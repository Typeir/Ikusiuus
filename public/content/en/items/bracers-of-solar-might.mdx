# Bracers of Solar Might

_Rare (requires attunement)_

These bracers are crafted from solidified **Torchtree sap**, a rare and volatile amber-like substance bled from the husks of parasitized **great trees** deep in the Brume. These strange trees sprout blazing leaves every few years, disrupting the natural night and day cycle across the land. The sap, when carefully refined, holds a fraction of that seasonal solar brilliance.
