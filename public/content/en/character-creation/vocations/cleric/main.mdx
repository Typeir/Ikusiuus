# Cleric

Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can channel divine magic from the Outer Planes to bolster allies and battle foes.

Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the force that unlocked their magic. Not every priest is a Cleric—some serve simply through prayer and ritual—but a true Cleric can marshal divine power in miraculous ways.
