# Trickery Domain

_Make Mischief and Challenge Authority._

The Trickery Domain grants magic of deception, illusion, and stealth. Clerics of this domain are disruptive forces in the world, mocking tyrants, freeing captives, and challenging hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge and mischief to direct confrontation.

Gods of trickery are patrons of thieves, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Some Trickery clerics operate openly, while others work in secret, undermining oppressive hierarchies and spreading chaos to provoke social change.

## 3rd Level – Invoke Duplicity

As a **Bonus Action**, expend a use of **Channel Divinity** to create a **perfect visual illusion** of yourself in an unoccupied space within **30 feet**.

- The illusion is **intangible** and **does not occupy space**.
- It lasts for **1 minute**, or until you **dismiss it (no action required)** or become **Incapacitated**.
- The illusion mimics your gestures and movements.

While the illusion persists, you gain the following benefits:

---

### Cast Spells

You can cast spells **as if you were in the illusion’s space**, but you must use **your own senses**.

---

### Distract

When both you and the illusion are within **5 feet of a creature** that can see the illusion, you have **Advantage on attack rolls** against that creature.

---

### Move

As a **Bonus Action**, you can move the illusion up to **30 feet** to an unoccupied space within **120 feet** of you.

---

## 6th Level – Trickster’s Transposition

When you create or move your **Invoke Duplicity illusion**, you can choose to **teleport**, swapping places with the illusion.

---

## 17th Level – Improved Duplicity

Your **Invoke Duplicity** illusion improves in the following ways:

### Shared Distraction

When you or your **allies** make attack rolls against a creature **within 5 feet of the illusion**, those rolls have **Advantage**.

---

### Healing Illusion

When the illusion ends, you or a creature of your choice **within 5 feet of it** regains **Hit Points equal to your Cleric level**.
