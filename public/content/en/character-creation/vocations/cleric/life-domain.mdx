# Life Domain

_Soothe the Hurts of the World._

The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that sustains life throughout the multiverse. Clerics who serve this domain are masters of healing, channeling divine power to cure wounds and protect the vulnerable.

Clerics of the Life Domain may worship agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, or deities of home and community. Religious orders of healers also often follow this domain.

## 3rd Level – Preserve Life

As a **Magic action**, you may present your **Holy Symbol** and expend a use of your **Channel Divinity** to restore Hit Points.

- Choose **Bloodied creatures** within **30 feet** of you (this can include you).
- You can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to **5 × your Cleric level**, divided among the chosen creatures.
- This healing cannot restore a creature to more than **half of its Hit Point maximum**.

## 6th Level – Blessed Healer

When you cast a **healing spell using a spell slot** that restores Hit Points to **one or more creatures other than yourself**, you also regain **Hit Points equal to 2 + the spell slot’s level**.

## 17th Level – Supreme Healing

When you would normally **roll dice to restore Hit Points** with a spell or **Channel Divinity**, you instead use the **maximum result of each die**.

For example, if you would roll **2d6**, you restore **12 Hit Points** instead.
