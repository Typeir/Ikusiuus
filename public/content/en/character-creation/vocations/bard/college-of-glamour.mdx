# College of Glamour

_Weave Beguiling Fey Magic._

The College of Glamour traces its origins to the beguiling magic of the Feywild. Bards who study this magic weave threads of beauty and terror into their songs and stories. The mightiest among them cloak themselves in otherworldly majesty, stirring up longing for forgotten innocence, evoking ancient fears, and tugging at the emotions of even the most hard-hearted listeners.

## 3rd Level – Beguiling Magic

You always have the following spells prepared:

- **[Charm Person](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:charm-person)**
- **[Mirror Image](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:mirror-image)**

In addition, immediately after you cast an **Enchantment** or **Illusion** spell using a spell slot, you can choose a creature you can see within **60 feet** to make a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **spell save DC**.

- On a **failed save**, the creature gains either the **Charmed** or **Frightened** condition (your choice) for **1 minute**.
- The creature may repeat the saving throw at the **end of each of its turns**, ending the effect on a success.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a **Long Rest**.  
You can also restore its use by expending one use of your **Bardic Inspiration** (no action required).

## 3rd Level – Mantle of Inspiration

As a **Bonus Action**, you can weave fey magic into a song or dance to inspire vigor.

- Expend a use of **Bardic Inspiration** and roll the die.
- Choose a number of creatures within **60 feet** of you, up to your **Charisma modifier** (minimum of one creature).
- Each creature gains **Temporary Hit Points equal to 2 × the number rolled** on your Bardic Inspiration die.
- Each chosen creature may also use its **Reaction** to move up to its **Speed**, without provoking **Opportunity Attacks**.

## 6th Level – Mantle of Majesty

You always have the **[Command](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:command)** spell prepared.

As a **Bonus Action**, you may cast **Command** without expending a spell slot. When you do, you take on an **unearthly appearance** for **1 minute**, or until your **Concentration** ends.

- During this time, you can cast **Command** as a **Bonus Action** without expending a spell slot.
- Any creature **Charmed** by you automatically fails its saving throw against **Command** spells cast using this feature.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a **Long Rest**.  
You can also restore its use by expending a **3rd-level spell slot or higher** (no action required).

## 14th Level – Unbreakable Majesty

As a **Bonus Action**, you can assume a **magically majestic presence** for **1 minute**, or until you are **Incapacitated**.

- For the duration, whenever a creature **hits you with an attack roll** for the first time on a turn, the attacker must succeed on a **Charisma saving throw** against your **spell save DC**, or the attack **misses** instead as the creature recoils from your majesty.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a **Short or Long Rest**.
