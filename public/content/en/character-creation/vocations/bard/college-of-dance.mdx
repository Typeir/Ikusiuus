# College of Dance

_Move in Harmony with the Cosmos._

Bards of the College of Dance know that the Words of Creation can't be contained within speech or song. The words are uttered by the movements of celestial bodies and flow through the motions of the smallest creatures. These Bards practice a way of being in harmony with the whirling cosmos that emphasizes agility, speed, and grace.
