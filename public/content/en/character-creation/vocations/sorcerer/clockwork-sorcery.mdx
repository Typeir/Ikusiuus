# Clockwork Sorcery

_Channel Cosmic Forces of Order_

The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it—a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency. You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it’s part of a vast and glorious system.

## Manifestations of Order

When you cast any of your Sorcerer spells, choose or randomly determine how your connection to order manifests:

| 1d6 | Manifestation                                                                                    |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Spectral cogwheels hover behind you.                                                             |
| 2   | The hands of a clock spin in your eyes.                                                          |
| 3   | Your skin glows with a brassy sheen.                                                             |
| 4   | Floating equations and geometric objects overlay your body.                                      |
| 5   | Your Spellcasting Focus temporarily takes the form of a Tiny clockwork mechanism.                |
| 6   | The ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be heard by you and those affected by your magic. |

## Level 3: Restore Balance

When a creature you can see within 60 feet is about to roll a d20 with **Advantage or Disadvantage**, you can take a **Reaction** to prevent the roll from being affected by either.

Uses: **Charisma modifier per Long Rest** (minimum of once).

---

## Level 6: Bastion of Law

As a **Magic action**, expend **1 to 5 Sorcery Points** to create a ward around yourself or another creature within 30 feet. The ward has a number of **d8s** equal to the points spent.

When the warded creature takes damage, it can roll any number of these dice to reduce the damage taken by the total rolled.

The ward lasts until you finish a Long Rest or use this feature again.

---

## Level 14: Trance of Order

As a **Bonus Action**, enter a trance for **1 minute**. While in the trance:

- Attack rolls against you can't gain **Advantage**.
- When you make a **d20 Test**, treat a roll of **9 or lower** as a **10**.

Once per Long Rest or restore by spending **5 Sorcery Points**.

---

## Level 18: Clockwork Cavalcade

As a **Magic action**, summon intangible spirits of order in a **30-foot Cube** originating from you. The spirits create the following effects before vanishing:

- **Heal:** Restore up to **100 Hit Points**, divided as you choose among creatures in the Cube.
- **Repair:** Instantly repair any damaged objects entirely in the Cube.
- **Dispel:** End all spells of level **6 or lower** on creatures and objects of your choice in the Cube.

Once per Long Rest or restore by spending **7 Sorcery Points**.
