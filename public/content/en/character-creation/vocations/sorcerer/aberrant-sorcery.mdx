# Aberrant Sorcery

_Wield Unnatural Psionic Power_

An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a terror to those who feel the stab of your mind?

Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed to the Far Realm’s warping influence. Alternatively, you were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer never occurred; now the tadpole’s psionic power is yours. However you acquired this power, your mind is aflame with it.

## Level 3: Telepathic Speech

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a **Bonus Action**, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you must share a language.

The connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Sorcerer level. It ends early if you use this ability again.

---

## Level 6: Psionic Sorcery

When you cast any level 1+ spell from your **Psionic Spells** feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot or by spending a number of Sorcery Points equal to the spell’s level.

If you cast the spell using Sorcery Points, it requires **no Verbal or Somatic components**, and no Material components unless they are consumed or have a cost.

---

## Level 6: Psychic Defenses

You gain **Resistance to Psychic damage** and **Advantage on saving throws** to avoid or end the **Charmed** or **Frightened** condition.

---

## Level 14: Revelation in Flesh

You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a **Bonus Action**, spend 1 or more Sorcery Points to magically alter your body for 10 minutes. For each Sorcery Point spent, gain one of the following benefits:

- **Aquatic Adaptation.** Swim Speed equal to twice your Speed; breathe underwater; gills or cilia manifest.
- **Glistening Flight.** Fly Speed equal to your Speed (hovering); your skin glistens unnaturally.
- **See the Invisible.** See Invisible creatures within 60 feet; eyes turn black or become tendrils.
- **Wormlike Movement.** Move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch; spend 5 feet of movement to escape nonmagical restraints or Grapple.

---

## Level 18: Warping Implosion

You unleash a space-warping anomaly. As a **Magic action**, teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet. Each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a **Strength saving throw** (DC = spell save DC).

- **Fail:** 3d10 Force damage and pulled toward the space you left.
- **Success:** Half damage, no pull.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend **5 Sorcery Points** to restore it.
