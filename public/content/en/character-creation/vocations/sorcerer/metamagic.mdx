## Metamagic Options

The following options are available to your Metamagic feature. The options are presented in alphabetical order.

### Careful Spell

**Cost:** 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. Choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.
