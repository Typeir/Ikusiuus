# Path of the World Tree

_Trace the Roots and Branches of the Multiverse._

Barbarians who follow the Path of the World Tree connect with the cosmic tree **Yggdrasil** through their **Rage**. This tree grows among the Outer Planes, linking all realms together. These Barbarians draw on its magic for vitality and as a means of dimensional travel.
