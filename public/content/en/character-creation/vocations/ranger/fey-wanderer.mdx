# Fey Wanderer

_Wield Fey Mirth and Fury_

A fey mystique surrounds you, thanks to the boon of an archfey or a location in the Feywild that transformed you. However you gained fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer. Your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your martial prowess strikes terror in your foesâ€”for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.

## 3rd Level: Dreadful Strikes

You can augment your weapon strikes with mind-scarring magic drawn from the murky hollows of the Feywild.

When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra **1d4 Psychic damage** to the target. A creature can take this extra damage only **once per turn**.

At Ranger level **11**, the extra damage increases to **1d6**.
