# Oath of Vengeance

_Punish Evildoers at Any Cost._

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who commit grievous acts of evil. When tyrants oppress the innocent, when dragons rampage, or when injustice festers unchecked, Paladins of this oath arise to set things right, no matter the personal cost.

**Tenets of Vengeance:**

- Show the wicked no mercy.
- Fight injustice and its causes.
- Aid those harmed by injustice.
