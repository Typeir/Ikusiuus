# Abjurer

_Shield Companions and Banish Foes_

Your study of magic focuses on spells that block, banish, or protect—ending harmful effects, banishing evil influences, and shielding allies. Abjurers are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when places must be warded against magical intrusion, or when planar portals need sealing. Adventurers value Abjurers for the protection they offer against hostile magic and other dangers.

## Level 3: Abjuration Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Abjuration school of level 2 or lower and add them to your spellbook for free.

Additionally, whenever you gain access to a new spell level, you can add one Abjuration spell of that level to your spellbook for free.

## Level 3: Arcane Ward

When you cast an Abjuration spell using a spell slot, you can weave part of its magic into a protective ward. The ward lasts until you finish a Long Rest.

- The ward has Hit Points equal to twice your Wizard level plus your Intelligence modifier.
- Whenever you take damage, the ward absorbs the damage first. Apply any Resistances or Vulnerabilities before reducing the ward’s Hit Points.
- If the ward is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you take any remaining damage. The ward remains but cannot absorb damage until restored.

Whenever you cast an Abjuration spell with a spell slot, the ward regains Hit Points equal to twice the slot level. You can also use a Bonus Action to expend a spell slot and heal the ward by twice the slot level.

Once you create the ward, you cannot create it again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 6: Projected Ward

When a creature within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your Reaction to project your Arcane Ward onto them. The ward absorbs the damage in place of the target. Apply any Resistances or Vulnerabilities the target has before reducing the ward’s Hit Points.

If the ward is reduced to 0 Hit Points, the creature takes any remaining damage.

## Level 10: Spell Breaker

You always have **Counterspell** and **Dispel Magic** prepared. When you cast **Dispel Magic**, you can do so as a Bonus Action, and you add your Proficiency Bonus to its ability check.

When you cast either spell with a spell slot and the attempt fails to stop a spell, the slot is not expended.

## Level 14: Spell Resistance

You have Advantage on saving throws against spells, and you have Resistance to spell damage.
