  "title": "Welcome To The Archives",
  "introOne": "Once held aloft by the trunks of the two mightiest <em>Olivares</em>, the Library of Ikuisuus stood in solemn grandeur—an impossible structure of green-black marble veined like old blood, suspended in stillness above the world. It was the Archivist’s greatest pride, a cathedral of silence and memory.<br></br><em>But what is raised high falls hardest.</em>",
  "introTwo": "When the Interlocking tore through the skein of the Hidden Kingdom, it struck the Library like a judgment. The fleeing moon dragged tides from the skies, the sun incinerated the rubble, and <em>Hiisi</em>, once caged by the fleeing <em>celestials</em>, fell screaming through the cracks. Amid this cataclysm, the library was the first to break—its marble spine shattering as if it had always been meant to fall.",
  "introThree": "Now, deep within the Wound, far from where it once crowned the world, a new Ikuisuus stirs. Unfinished, half-sunken, malformed—yet it still glows with a strange beauty. And so the Archivist’s dream to document <em>the vile and beautiful lands of Damocles</em>, may yet be caught."
