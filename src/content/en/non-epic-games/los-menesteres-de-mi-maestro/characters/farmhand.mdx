# THE FARMHAND - LORE

_Your bees are dead. They are dead and eviscerated. They have been mauled and brutalized. You intended on giving the master a bottle of honey as a
celebration for his research, and now you can't. Because your bees are dead, and your honey is spoiled. You locked the door to the hives. Nobody could've gotten in.
But they did._

_When the trial wrongfully cleared your murder charges, you decided you would never again pick up the knife, for your own sake. But the urge to slit the throats of those who killed your bees and spoiled your honey
are beginning to overpower you. You know people here keep too many secrets, and it's rubbing you the wrong way.
You stole the apothecary's scalpel._
