# THE DOCTOR - LORE

_Three nights before Aristides left the stead, he showed up at your clinic with grievous wounds covering his abdomen and chest.
He insisted they were caused by a wild boar. You sutured them and applied the apothecary's ointments, but they barely did a thing.
He ended up leaving on horseback with open wounds three days later. You didn't tell anyone; Aristides told you not to. You've been tending to
an injured landshark that found its way into the clinic the other day. The thing is afflicted by something you don't recognize; its blood runs
black and clogs, and its skin flakes off like the stones they use for tiling. Weirdly enough, it behaves healthy, if a bit lethargic.
Still, you worry about contagion._
