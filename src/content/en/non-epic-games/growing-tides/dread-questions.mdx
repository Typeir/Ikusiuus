# Character building

1. **What first drew you to work on the oil rigs of Thule?**

2. **Are you of Sunborn, Human, Hobbit, Dwarven, Gnomish or Empyrean ascent? Which cultural trait is the one that sets you apart from others?**

3. **The pay is decent, but life on the rig is harsh and isolating. What personal reason keeps you here, despite the conditions and danger?**

4. **Back home, is there anyone waiting for you?**

5. **The recent fall of the sun god Päimar has cast strange shadows over the world. How do you feel about this event, and what fear or superstition does it stir within you?**

6. **You’ve seen more disappearances and accidents on this rig than you’d like to admit. Do you think they're just occupational hazards, or is there something more sinister going on?**

7. **A coworker you were once close to had an in-site accident and they had to be transported back to mainland. How do you feel about this?**

8. **There’s an area on the rig, perhaps a certain corridor or room, that feels... wrong. Where is it, and what do you feel every time you have to pass through or work there?**

9. **Every night you hear something in your sleep—whispers, creaking, or something else. What is it, and why do you think it might be calling to you specifically?**

10. **You’ve just found something left behind by the missing worker, What is it, and why does the sight of it fill you with a sudden, overwhelming dread?.**
