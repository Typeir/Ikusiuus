# Rolling in Damocles

Not all rolls in Damocles follow the same structure. This section outlines the different kinds of rolls used across the system.

---

## Important Notes

**Confirmed Rolls** are for moments where risk doubles, an action is just barely possible with enough luck _(like throwing potions directly into mouths)_, or some higher power has altered the playing field. They should not be routine.

**Raw Rolls** are for situations where **only understanding**, **discipline**, **practice**, or **the intrinsic self** matter. They ignore all magical, circumstantial, and external aids.  
As such, **grafts** and **permanent alterations** to the self might give one an edge in these cases.

---

## Standard Rolls

Most checks in Damocles follow the standard **d20 roll + modifiers** system:

- **Ability Checks** – d20 + relevant ability modifiers
- **Attack Rolls** – d20 + relevant attack modifiers
- **Saving Throws** – d20 + relevant save modifiers

---

## Critical Hits

In Damocles, **critical rolls exist only for attack rolls**. a **20** does not mean an automatic success, a **1** does not mean an automatic failure.
_Some things are bound to happen, no matter what the die says, others are forbidden by the whims of fate_.

---

## Advantage and Disadvantage

When rolling with **Advantage**, roll **two d20s** and take the **higher result**.  
When rolling with **Disadvantage**, roll **two d20s** and take the **lower result**.  
These cancel each other out and are **not stackable**.

These follow standard rules.

---

## Inspiration

If a character has **Inspiration**, they may spend it to reroll a single **d20**, be it friend or foe.  
If the triggering roll has **advantage** or **disadvantage**, the new one **does not**.

## Special Roll Types

---

### Raw Roll [RR]

A **Raw Roll [RR]** is a check where:

- You roll **d20 + specified modifier, if any**.
- **No other modifiers**, rerolls, magical effects, items, or features may apply.  
  This includes bonuses from spells like _Bless_, bardic inspiration, or magic items.  
  Only the **raw Intelligence modifier** is used by default.
- **Alterations to the self** do affect this roll—if one **grafts** a monstrous appendage that increases their strength tenfold, they may succeed where they otherwise couldn’t.

Raw Rolls represent **accumulated comprehension and effort**, or **the intrinsic self**, not talent, magic, or luck.

---

#### When to Use Raw Rolls

Use a **Raw Roll [RR]** when:

- The task reflects **pure understanding or practice**, not circumstantial luck.
- The character is **learning, crafting, researching**, or otherwise advancing themselves over time.
- The world demands a **test of will or self**, such as handling forbidden artifacts or engaging with metaphysical machinery.

---

### Confirmed Roll [CR]

A **Confirmed Roll [CR]** represents actions where success requires **both execution and confirmation**.

- Roll **d20 + relevant modifiers** against the DC.
- If the **first roll succeeds**, **roll again** (using the same modifiers).
- **Both rolls must succeed** for **full success**.
- If only the **first roll succeeds**, a **partial success** **always occurs**.

---

#### Example of Partial Success

For instance, if you **throw a potion at an ally**, the first roll determines if you hit them at all—this may result in the potion **striking their body and dealing damage**.  
However, if the **second roll fails**, the potion **won’t activate properly**, and no healing occurs.

_Success is a fickle word._

---

#### When to Use Confirmed Rolls

Use a **Confirmed Roll [CR]** when:

- The action is resisted by **metaphysical forces** (e.g., null-magic zones, artifact activation, curses or blessings).
- The consequences of failure are **catastrophic**, or the action represents a **chain of uncertain steps**.
- The action could **plausibly happen out of sheer luck**, but carries **adverse consequences** for partial failure.
- The GM determines the situation involves **compounding risk**, or where multiple stages of failure are meaningful.

---

### Deliberate Roll [DR]

A **Deliberate Roll [DR]** allows a character to **default to a fixed result** when no danger, urgency, or metaphysical risk is involved.

If the check is **repeatable and safe**:

- Spend **25 minutes**: Treat the d20 as a **10**.
- Spend **50 minutes**: Treat the d20 as a **20**.

After which, relevant modifiers apply accordingly.

This represents careful, methodical work, study, or focus.  
It does not apply when circumstances prevent deliberate action (combat, life-threatening conditions).

---

#### When to Use Deliberate Rolls

Use a **Deliberate Roll [DR]** when:

- The task is **safe, repeatable, and allows for patient effort**.
- Time is available, and there’s no penalty for taking longer.
- The check represents **study, inspection, or careful execution** without pressure.

---

### Attack Rolls

- A **natural 20** on an **attack roll** is a **critical hit**.  
  **All damage dice are doubled**.
- A **natural 1** on an **attack roll** is a **critical miss**.  
  The GM may assign additional consequences, especially if the miss is reckless or dangerous.

---

### Skill Checks and Saving Throws

- **Skill checks and saving throws do not have critical hits or failures**.
- A **natural 1** is **not an automatic failure**.
- A **natural 20** is **not an automatic success**.

Only the **final total matters**. Some tasks are **impossible no matter the roll**, and some are **inevitable no matter the hand**.
