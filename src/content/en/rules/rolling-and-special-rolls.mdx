# Rolling in Damocles

Not all rolls in Damocles follow the same structure. This section outlines the different kinds of rolls used across the system.

---

## Important Notes

**Confirmed Rolls** are for moments where risk doubles, an action is just barely possible with enough luck _(like throwing potions directly into mouths)_, or some higher power has altered the playing field. They should not be routine.

**Raw Rolls** are for situations where **only understanding**, **discipline**, **practice**, or **the intrinsic self** matter. They ignore all magical, circumstantial, and external aids.
As such, **grafts** and **permanent alterations** to the self might give one an edge in this cases.

## Standard Rolls

Most checks in Damocles follow the standard **d20 roll + modifiers\*** system:

- **Ability Checks** – d20 + relevant ability modifiers\*
- **Attack Rolls** – d20 + relevant attack modifiers\*
- **Saving Throws** – d20 + relevant save modifiers\*

---

## Advantage and Disadvantage

When rolling with **Advantage**, roll **two d20s** and take the **higher result**.  
When rolling with **Disadvantage**, roll **two d20s** and take the **lower result**.
These cancel each other out and are **not stackable**.

These follow standard rules.

## Inspiration

If a character has **Inspiration**, they may spend it to reroll a single **d20**, be it friend or foe. If the triggering roll has **advantage** or **disadvantage**, the new one **does not**.

## Special Roll Types

---

### Raw Roll [RR]

A **Raw Roll [RR]** is a check where:

- You roll **d20 + specified modifier, if any**.
- **No other modifiers\***, rerolls, magical effects, items, or features may apply.  
  This includes bonuses from spells like _Bless_, bardic inspiration, or magic items. Only the raw Intelligence modifier is used.
  Alterations to the self do affect this roll, so if one **grafts** a monstruous appendage that increases their strength tenfold, they might be able to pass a roll they could not have otherwise.
- Raw Rolls represent **accumulated comprehension and effort**, or **the intrinsic self**, not talent, magic, or luck.

**Common Uses:**  
Training, learning, crafting, research, and long-form personal advancement, tests of will such as picking the _Dreamcatcher_ up.

### Confirmed Roll [CR]

A **Confirmed Roll [CR]** represents actions where success requires **both execution and confirmation**.

- Roll **d20 + relevant modifiers** against the DC.
- If the **first roll succeeds**, **roll again** (using the same modifiers).
- **Both rolls must succeed** for **full success**.
- If only the **first roll succeeds**, a **partial success** **always occurs**.

#### Example of Partial Success

For instance, if you **throw a potion at an ally**, the first roll determines if you hit them at all—this may result in the potion **striking their body and dealing damage**.  
However, if the **second roll fails**, the potion **won’t activate properly**, and no healing occurs.

_Success is a fickle word._

#### When to Use Confirmed Rolls

Use a **Confirmed Roll [CR]** when:

- The action is resisted by **metaphysical forces** (e.g., Fold breaches, artifact activation).
- The consequences of failure are **catastrophic**, or the action represents a **chain of uncertain steps**.
- The GM determines the situation involves **compounding risk**, or multiple stages of failure are meaningful.
