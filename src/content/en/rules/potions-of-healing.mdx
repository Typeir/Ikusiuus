# Potions of Healing

Potions of healing, as they’re commonly known, are small phials crafted from glass, hollowed gourds, or waterproofed pumice stones. Their contents react violently with air, catalyzing the rapid closure of wounds and the regrowth of damaged tissue.

Each potion contains a **lesser heirloom**—a small bearing or shard, prepared to bridge the gap between the world and the Folds. Without it, the potion would be inert. The heirloom anchors the body to the torrent, channeling the Fold’s raw current into a form the flesh can understand, be it sinew, bone, breath or memory.

Alongside this, the draught induces a **settling calm**, dulling both pain and mental strain. Whether this repairs psychic injury or merely masks it is debated, but few complain in the moment.

**All potions leave behind toxins**. These are a mixture of the inevitable metabolic byproducts of forced regeneration, and the foldscum, dead energy that's hard to dispel without enough time. This effect is lessened in higher-quality brews, hence the ludicrous price hike.

Potions of healing are **Strictly magical**.

**They do not function in null-magic zones**, such as those produced by higher creatures of the Fold, or by certain scions of the Dreamcatcher.

## Potion Sickness

The body cannot tolerate endless alchemical healing.

- Upon drinking the **5th potion**, you become **Poisoned for 8 hours**.
- Each potion **after the 5th** causes:
  - **Poisoned condition (refreshes to 8 hours each time)**
  - **+1 level of Exhaustion per extra potion**

This limit **resets** once the body is left to rest, with no heavily demanding activity, for at least seven uninterrupted days** (long rest)**.

| Potions Drunk in One Long Rest | Effect                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 1–5                            | No side effects         |
| 5th                            | Poisoned for 8 hours    |
| 6th                            | Poisoned + 1 Exhaustion |
| 7th                            | Poisoned + 2 Exhaustion |
| 8th                            | Poisoned + 3 Exhaustion |
| 9th                            | Poisoned + 4 Exhaustion |
| 10th                           | Poisoned + 5 Exhaustion |
| 11th                           | **Death**               |

## Potion Usage

A potion can be **drunk by the user as a bonus action**, as the phials are small and easy to use, and **one might even crush** it and hope the debris get's cleaned by the **lesser heirloom's intervention**.
Pouring one down someone else’s throat takes longer— **a full action** is required to administer a potion **to another creature**.

## Throwing a Potion

Potions can be thrown, though this is a risky business. Treat it as a **ranged attack** with a **confirmable roll** against the target’s Armor Class.

- **If the throw hits**, the potion **deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage** from the impact. This can kill a dying character if they already have **two failed death saving throws**.
- **If confirmed**, the potion **takes effect and heals as normal**.
- **If not confirmed**, the potion **does not heal**—it simply breaks and causes damage.

## Potion Prices

Some merchants, perfumers, thieves, alchemists or wizards **might sell potions**, naturally, a backalley grafter will sell ointments and drugs of the worse quality, while a millenia-old empyrean patron might even hold the keys to a few **ancient draughts**

For those savvy in the art of trading, the following scripture is offered:

| Potion Type     | Healing Formula | Average Healing | Price (GP - equivalent) | HP per GP |
