# Rest and Recovery

In Damocles, the world does not heal quickly.

Only **legendary heroes**—the kind chanted about in taverns, sung by trovadeurs, or carved into stone—can sustain **days of battle without rest**.

For ordinary mortals, no matter how skilled, the **body deteriorates** under endless strain.

Muscles tear at microscopic levels. Reflexes dull. The mind frays from overexposure to threat. Even if magic is not used directly, the Fold’s currents leak into everything touched by heirlooms or enchanted steel.

For those who wield magicks, the **Fold is dangerous**, and using it strains the body in ways not even a surgeon can repair.

A soldier can fight for a day. A hero might fight for three.  
But without rest, **all warriors will eventually fall to exhaustion**.

## Short Rest

A **short rest** is any period of **8 hours** spent in relative safety, where no intense activity is performed.  
This allows for basic recovery: catching breath, tending to wounds, adjusting bearings, eating, drinking, and most importantly—Sleeping.

Some heirlooms and abilities refresh after a short rest. Some even refresh at specific intervals in time.  
But wounds do not close fully, and deeper fatigue remains.

## Long Rest

A **long rest** is **7 uninterrupted days** of low-exertion living.  
This does not mean idleness, but it does mean stepping back from battle, magic, and trauma—For the most part, the vile and beautiful lands of Damocles never offered much rest for the wicked.

## What Happens During a Long Rest

Over the course of a long rest:

- The body rebuilds tissues damaged by Fold overuse.
- The mind stabilizes after exposure to metaphysical currents.
- Magic reservoirs, if any, regain integrity, though most mortals lack them altogether.
- Exhaustion and potion sickness fade.

## Important Notes

- A long rest must not be **interrupted by no medium, hard or worse encounters, extreme Fold usage, or continuous travel** though easier means of travel, such as **a caravan** or a **vehicle** can be considered resting.
- As such, an **easy** encounter might not be much in the way of a long rest.
- Characters who cannot find rest may survive—but they will degrade. If a character does not have at least a short rest a day, they will incur **two levels of exhaustion** after a progressing Constitution saving throw (DC 15 + 5 per consecutive day awake)

## Why This Is Necessary

- A **wizard** who rips the Fold apart to ignite their will is not just casting a spell—they are **shredding the threads of their own body**, channeling alchemical precursor, and forcing seams in reality to align with personal desire.  
  This leaves scars on places no surgeon can reach.

- A **paladin** who smites their enemies is not simply calling on faith. They are **rupturing the fabric of the world with their own marrow**, letting it act as conduit and beacon.  
  This has consequences.

- Even a warrior who swings a Heirloom-blade is dragging fragments of the current through metal and tendon, wearing down unseen reserves.

## On Martial Recovery

Most fighters, scouts, and frontline combatants rely on **short rest recovery**, their energy replenished after a good night's sleep.

This reflects the reality of their craft: tending wounds, rewrapping grips, repositioning cracked ribs, stitching tendon back to bone, caring for their armaments...
