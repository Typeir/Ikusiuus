## Downtime: Learning and Training

Between expeditions and conflicts, characters may spend time training or studying. Skills and crafts are not often gained through sudden insightâ€”they usually require time, dedication, and patronage.

---

### Important Notes

- _All rolls are **Intelligence checks**. Only the character's **Intelligence modifier** applies. No spells, items, or abilities may alter these rolls. This is known as a **Raw Roll [RR]**_

### Learning a Tool, Language, or Weapon Proficiency

A character may train to gain proficiency with a **new set of tools, a language, or a specific weapon**.

- **Duration:** 250 days
- **Cost:** 1 gp per day (total: 250 gp)
- **Requirement:** Access to a competent instructor, tools, or documentation sufficient to teach the craft.

---

#### Exam and Mastery

At the end of training, the character must pass a test of capability.

- Raw Roll [RR] **Int DC 20**.
- **On failure:** the character may retry after another 250 days of training. Each retry reduces the DC by **5 points**, to a minimum of **DC 5**.

---

### Learning a Skill Proficiency

Learning a new **skill proficiency** is possible but more difficult.

- **Duration:** 250 days
- **Cost:** 5 gp per day (total: 1250 gp)
- **Requirement:** Access to relevant instruction or practice opportunities.

---

#### Skill Training Stages

Skill proficiency is learned in stages:

- After the first 250 days:
  - Raw Roll [RR] **Int DC 20**.
  - **On success:** gain **half proficiency** (rounded down).
  - **On failure:** the character may retry after another 250 days of training. Each retry reduces the DC by **5 points**, to a minimum of **DC 5**.
- To gain **full proficiency**, the character must train for **an additional 250 days** (total 500 days).
- After the second training period:
  - Raw Roll [RR] **Int DC 25**.
  - **On success:** gain full proficiency.
  - **On failure:** the character retains half proficiency and may retry after another 250 days of training. Each retry reduces the DC by **5 points**, to a minimum of **DC 5**.

### Learning an Armor Proficiency

Armor is a deceitfully complex topic. Most military men take years to blend in with their plate and not exhaust themselves by merely walking around in a tin can. Learning to use one is a Sisyphean endeavor.

- **Duration:** 250 days
- **Cost:** 10 gp per day (total: 2500 gp)
- **Requirement:** Access to relevant instruction or practice opportunities.

---

#### Armor Training

Armor proficiency is scaffolded:

- One must first learn to use **light armor**, then **medium**, then **heavy**.
- After each 250-day period:
  - Raw Roll [RR] **Int DC 30**.
  - **On failure:** the character may retry after another 250 days of training. Each retry reduces the DC by **5 points**, to a minimum of **DC 5**.
