# Heirlooms and Attunement

A **Heirloom** is any object that innately wields magic, syphoned from the folds.
These objects usually require a calibration process if they're complex enough, as interfacing with them is a complicated endeavor.
A heirloom reshapes the primeval, endless energy current of the folds into an usable form— wether it is to ignite flame, crush bones or tear the very firmaments.

## Attunement

To use a heirloom, one must be **attuned** to it.

- Attunement requires **one uninterrupted hour spent with the object**, adjusting its mechanisms to match the user’s body. This usually involves handling or fine manipulation, but some more advanced methods can attune rather independently.
- **Breaking attunement** also requires **one uninterrupted hour**.
- A heirloom becomes unattuned if:
  - The user takes an hour to break the link.
  - The heirloom is destroyed.
  - Someone else attunes to the same heirloom.

Attunement is not mystical; it is **calibration**.

## Usage Limits

A person may only maintain **three heirlooms** in working alignment at once.

Two heirlooms **cannot occupy the same slot** on the body. The Fold does not tolerate overlap.

For example:  
Two head-slot heirlooms cannot function together. The Fold-access points on the head will interfere.

## Fold Deduplication

If a person attempts to wear or use two heirlooms in the same slot, the Fold responds violently.

- The user is **hit** by **Fold Deduplication**.
- **Both** heirlooms considered the triggers.

This is not a punishment; it is a law. One cannot rip the Folds open twice in the same spot without letting hell through.

---

## Suppression

- Heirlooms may be **suppressed in null-magic zones**, such as those caused by higher Fold entities or certain scions of the Dreamcatcher.
- **Suppression does not break attunement**. The connection remains but the heirloom cannot function until the suppression ends.

### Oversight

There is **no mechanical tracker** for heirloom use.  
The **Game Director** is advised to monitor heirloom interactions and prevent abuse through judgment, not bookkeeping.
