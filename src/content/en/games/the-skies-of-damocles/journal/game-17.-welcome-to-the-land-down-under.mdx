## 📖 **Session Recap**

After returning to **Tripoda**, the party set off into the **dangerous outskirts**, navigating through **towering sunflower-like trees** under Niccolo’s guidance.

During their travels, they encountered an **abandoned mill**, where they overheard **two men discussing a wasp hive blocking the road**. While **Niccolo believed them**, the rest of the party **suspected a ruse**, as signs of a **past magical battle** were present. Rather than risk an **ambush**, the party opted for a **safer route through a waterfall pass**—though **it soon proved to be just as deadly**.

As they made their way through, they were **ambushed by a swarm of Horned Horrors**, **massive Tripodan Blue Wasps** whose **stingers contained a potent paralyzing venom**. The fight was **brutal**, and **Sigus was stung multiple times**, causing him to **collapse into a deep, venom-induced slumber for an entire day**.

Despite their injuries, the party **managed to harvest 7 stingers**, which **Lystig later used to craft paralysis arrows**. With **Sigus still unconscious**, the group set up camp and prepared to push forward deeper into **Tripoda’s treacherous wilderness**.
