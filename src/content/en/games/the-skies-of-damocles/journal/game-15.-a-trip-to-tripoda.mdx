## 📖 **Session Recap**

The party traveled to **Tripoda**, reaching the capital **Caldia**, where they reconnected with **Niccolo**, who had acquired new magical items during his absence. They then visited the **White Ravens' encampment**, situated near the **Tripodan coast**, to inform them that they would be taking the full **six-month preparation period** to pursue personal matters. **Annabelle and the Ravens agreed**, allowing them to operate independently while the **Borossan forces** continued their preparations for war.

While in Caldia, **Sigus received an invitation** from **Camille of Cavar**, asking him to visit **Verbrune**, the **volcanic mountain at the heart of Tripoda**. The message suggested that the **Society of Hidden Knowledge**, a group of scholars and wizards, sought to **conduct "benign experiments" on him** to further understand his connection to his master.

Meanwhile, Lystig **reflected on the strange engine he had discovered in Borossa’s National Museum**, which bore **his own artificer signature** despite his amnesia. He noted that it had been **recovered from the coast of Horngrove, near the Cerulean Forests**, raising more questions about his past.

As the party prepared for their next steps, they realized they would need a **ship** to reach **Sigus’s master**. Among their options was a **Brumean signora offering passage**, but they ultimately **decided against it** and instead **stole a ship** that had made an emergency landing. Thanks to **Ukko’s sailing experience**, they successfully commandeered the vessel.

As they **sailed toward Anthule**, Sigus noted something odd—**the ocean seemed unnaturally calm**, with **waves dying before reaching the ship**, as if **guided by unseen forces**.

The session ended as the party ventured deeper into open waters, bound for their next destination.
