## 📖 **Session Recap**

The **party battled the Colossus**, a **regenerating, shrimp-spawning behemoth**, in an attempt to **free the trapped Väki spirits**. Their plan fell apart when **Lystig accidentally Fireballed Ukko**, leading to **a chaotic struggle**. Ukko **tore out the monster’s core**, ending the fight.

As **thanks**, the freed **Väki** **gifted Ukko an ancient fighting technique** and **a mysterious hilt**. The **winds of Borossa returned**, signaling that something **long-lost had been restored**.

After **escaping through the submerged ruins**, the party surfaced in **Dhanas** and **consulted blacksmiths and historians**, confirming that the **ancient armor belonged to warriors who once slew the Sun God**. However, **Lystig made a startling discovery**—a recovered **engine bearing his own signature**, despite **his amnesia preventing him from recalling its creation**.

With **more questions than answers**, the party decided to **leave for Tripoda**, using the **Tripodan International Port to set sail for Anthule**, seeking **Sigus’ master** on the **Coast of Spires**.
