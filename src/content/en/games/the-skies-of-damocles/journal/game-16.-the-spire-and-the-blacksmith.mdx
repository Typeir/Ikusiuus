## 📖 **Session Recap**

Upon arriving at **Sigus’s master’s spire**, the party found a **Brumean slave trader impaled** on a **spiked gate**, a familiar sight to Sigus, who welcomed himself home without hesitation. Inside, they discovered a **cursed child**, whose **left side had grotesquely mutated** due to **Albedo's influence**. Sigus’s master was carefully **chiseling away at the corruption**, attempting to restore the child’s form.

The party marveled at the **architecture of the spire**, constructed from **primordial wax** and adorned with **tapestries of constellations**. As they took in the strange surroundings, Sigus’s master mentioned that **another visitor had arrived before them**—a **mysterious ambassador** named **Enki**.

Enki, a **feline Sunborn**, carried an **array of weapons** and spoke in **cryptic terms**. He insisted that **Sigus had been summoned for an important reason**, but refused to reveal why until Sigus had spoken with his master. Enki assured him, however, that **all who follow the stars must eventually face this moment**.

After a **night of rest**, Sigus finally sat down with his master, who revealed the truth: **he and Sigus were fated to duel to the death** on the **next solstice**, when the **Light of Creation** would be closest to Damocles. **Sigus was shaken**, but his master assured him that this was **the way of their kind**—that one of them would live on within the other.

At first, **Sigus resisted the idea**, but **Enki explained the consequences of defying the stars**, revealing that another **follower of the stars**, **Assir**, often **interceded in such duels**, forcing others to fight before their time.

Meanwhile, **Enki and Ukko spoke privately atop the spire**. Enki revealed that **the Väki following Ukko, appearing in the form of a white cat, was one of many lesser world spirits** that had been **sealed away after the rise of the Sun God**. He also confirmed that Ukko’s **jade-like hilt was a key artifact**, capable of **leading him to the remaining spirits**.

After a week of contemplation, **Sigus confronted his master once more** and **agreed to the duel**, formally **signing the necessary paperwork** with Enki as a witness. **With their fates sealed, Sigus bid his master farewell**, knowing that **one of them would not survive the coming solstice**.

Soon after, the party **departed from the spire and set sail back to Tripoda**.
