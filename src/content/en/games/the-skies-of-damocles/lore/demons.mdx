# **Demons / Hiisi:**

---

## _Common_

**Demons**, known as **Hiisi** by those of the southern states of Thule, and the citizens of Anthule (users of the old tongues) are erratic beings most often associated with popular songs and folklore, whose existence is not usually given any real credence.

**Hiisi** are believed to be evil tricksters that poison people in exchange for monetary gains of some sort. Most people who fall deathly ill after being struck by uncared for iron blades are assumed to have been tainted by the **Hiisi**, and so **crude iron** has earned itself an association with the demonkind.

During the yearly harvest festivals in the southern states, dancers will dress up as the four **Hiisi** that wounded the world, each represented by a different step in the cycle of rebirth, (The black one, who represents **death** or **putrefaction**, the white one, which represents **growth** or **change**, the yellow one, which represents **enlightenment** or **purification**, and the red one, which represents **wholeness** or **power eternal**) and perform a dance in order to rebirth the crops, much like the world was rebirthed from the brink of extinction multiple millenia ago.

## _Advanced_

**Demons** are real creatures, they exist among the citizens of each and every culture, most of them benign, farmers whose crops grow unnaturaly fast and of better quality than others, beekepers whose bees behave and never escape their enclosure, lawyers that always seem to get favorable veredicts or rulings...

Some of the **Hiisi** are vicious creatures that only work for ulterior motives, some simply wish to live unbothered by others, but all of them require the presence of clear, **contractual terms** in order to interact with others. Most of them are smart enough that they'll phrase their words in such a way that'll make those they're talking to not realize they're agreeing to the **Demon's** terms, be they benign or not. Some will simply take advantage of lesser creatures, such as animals or plants, as **their tongue is universal**.

**Demons** are speculated to originate from the **Hidden kingdom**, as many such creatures do, but there's dispute as to wether they're part of the pieni, the old gods, some other undiscovered branch of creatures from that realm...

## _Deep_

**Hiisi** are the bastard children of the sun god **Päivätär**, they were discarded after their births and roamed the **Hidden Kingdom**, horrifying it's denizens for eons. After the **Interlocking**, most **Hiisi** chose to stay within the eternally stretching ruins of the shifted landscapes, making them their homes, but some escaped the **Hidden Kingdom**. Those who stayed, eventually grew a sedentary, scholarly culture, and became known as **The Silent Ones**, those who left, simply became **Demons** to the denizens of **Damocles**.

Of the **Hiisi** which escaped the **Hidden Kingdom**, four are most prominent, and were supposedly felled during the **Scarring**.

**Nigredo**
**Albedo**
**Xanthous**
**Rubedo**

## _Truth_

**The Four** were scions of the **Dream Catcher** having heard it's call through the veil. They broke the veil in an attempt to find it and give it back to it's destined owner, **The White Homunculus** of legend, their deeds were as follows:

- **Nigredo**: Conspired with **Anaximandro**, duke of **Pyknos** and first of the **Lords of the Dead**.
- **Albedo**: Conspired with **Lycophron** to convince the **Empyreans** to enhance their war machinery with machines utilizing the recently discovered fossil fuels, **Lychophron** was the ruler of a small port-town which now rests below the tides near melumbo.
- **Xanthous**: Conspired with **Gorgias**, duke of **Taeda** to establish a rogue state that would eventually become the **Sacred Brume Empire**, long after the **Scarring** and first of the **Lords of the Dead**.
- **Rubedo**: Conspired with **Plato** against his own brothers and fellow **Lords of the Dead** to escape their **clone-world** into the **world-seed**. They succeeded, and now exist within the **world-seed**, having been **disambiguated** and thus their equals in other **clone-worlds** **Redacted** from existence. He was an advisor to the **Empyrean** lords, and last of the **Lords of the Dead**.

All of the demons were prominent figures during the **War of the Wound**, and fought along with humans and the **Lords of the Dead** against the **Empyrean Empire**.

Additionally, some **Hiisi** exist in positions of power, such as **Father** who is the **De-facto** ruler of **Borossa**, as he commands Queen Camile of Cavar.
