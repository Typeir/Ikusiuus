**Borossa** is a nation located in the ocean that separates Thule from Anthule, very close to Thulean coasts. It is considered the melting pot of the world and a safe haven for traders and criminals alike. **Borossa** is a highly religious monarchy, but it is very permissive regarding individual rights.

Most of **Borossa's** inhabitants are **Sunborn**, granting them many Thulean enemies. **Borossa** praises the sun god **Päivätär**, but there is religious freedom. Most of these suborn are of feline appearence, seeming to hail from the war-torn land of **Cavar**.

**Borossa** has its roots in piracy and is very proud of its sailors and pirates, often granting piracy rights to militias. **Borossa** has a weak army and relies mostly on an over-budgeted navy and militias to protect itself.

It is governed by King **Boros the tenth** and Queen **Camile of Cavar**, a human woman of about 30 years. **Boros** has two kids, **Boros the eleventh** and **Cedos the first**. **Boros** and **Cedos** are known to be at odds.

## _Advanced_

**Borossa** is mostly controlled by gangs and mafias, most of them playing the part of peacekeepers, and most city guards are not officials but henchmen. **Boros the eleventh** is the son of **Boros the tenth** and his deceased wife, **Joanna**. **Cedos** is an adopted child, hailing from an undisclosed location in the west. **Cedos** is suspected to be the main orchestrator of the **Cedossan Liberation Movement**. **Borossa** is currently engaged in a defensive war against the **Brumish Empire** that's being concealed from the general populace.

**Borossa** is home to the biggest precursor mine beyond **The Wound**, located in the **Erebian Crags**. **Tripoda**, located in the **Borossan Archipelago**, is home to a family of beasts unique to the region. **Tripoda** has a second family of native beasts, known as **Sun Cats**. They are smart creatures that can use but not make simple tools, and communicate with roars and sounds similar to those of string instruments, produced with their petal-like manes. **Borossa** boasts one of the largest underground systems of **Damocles**; most of it is abandoned and dangerous, but some parts are used as underground boat canals.

**Camile of Cavar** is a powerful sorceress and is often seen as a bodyguard to the king.

## _Deep_

**Amon Grimalkin** is the true father of **Cedos the first**. **Joanna** was a member of the **Grimalkin** family. **Galán**, the mafia kingpin from the **Courier Guild**, holds immense political power and is in charge of most higher-ups, with the king being relegated to a symbolic position.

**Cedos's** true name is Imran, he's a Cavarian refugee from the war with the **Holy Brume Empire**.

The underground channels of **Borossa** were built before the founding of the current city, and although it has been rebuilt time and time again, some of the most disheveled sections still show the older architecture. The underground is home to several crime gangs, most notably the **Courier Guild** and **The Whimpers**, but also the headquarters of the **Cedossan Liberation Front**.

The **Society of Hidden Knowledge**, an informal group of researchers and wizards of gray morality, makes their home on the island of **Tripoda**, a safe haven for them because of the dangers its surface poses.

**Camile of Cavar** is a member of the **Society of Hidden Knowledge**, although her motives to be with the king are unknown. **Camile of Cavar** is suspected to have enthralled the king, taking advantage of his old age and already broken psyche.

## _Truth_

**Borossa** was originally built by escapees from the belows, through a series of tunnels and crevices that connected to the **Grand City of Thealas**. The tunnels that connect it to the **Grand City** still exist but are roamed by **The Chase** and are thus extremely dangerous. **Borossa** was mostly comprised of tunnels and hidden settler architecture back then.

**Joanna** was slain by **Boros the tenth** in a mad rage when he discovered her affiliation with **Kuutar** cultists. **Boros** also tried to slay his eldest son, **Cedos the first**, who now calls himself **Grimalkin Junior**, and lives with his uncle, **Amon Grimalkin**. **Grimalkin Junior** is the true heir of **Borossa**. He was presumed dead by **Boros** after being brutally stabbed as a child. **Grimalkin Junior** survived thanks to his uncle.

**Galan** knows of this and uses this knowledge to leverage power against **Boros**. **Camile of Cavar** did not enthrall the king but simply fed his delusions with her knowledge from the society. **Camile** wants **Galan** dead so the society can take control of the city, but it's not a fight she can pick while the king lives. The **Society of Hidden Knowledge** believes the golden path holds power over the **Hidden Kingdom**, the main focus of their research, and thus pull strings in the **Borossan Theocracy** in order to gain access to it.
