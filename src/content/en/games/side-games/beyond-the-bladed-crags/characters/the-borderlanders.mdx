### What They Are

The Borderlanders are **giants**—brutal, red-faced, white-furred, and **utterly cruel**. They live deep in the **Bladed Crags**, ambushing anyone who dares to pass. They don’t serve a cause. They don’t guard anything.  
They **steal, kill, and vanish**, leaving **no survivors**, and **no mercy**.

They are part of the reason why travelers believe the world ends at the edge.  
It doesn’t.  
**The Borderlanders just make sure you never reach what’s beyond.**

### Takka – The Quiet Blade

_Leader • Executioner • Stoic Giant_

- **15 ft tall**, massive and scarred
- White fur, painted in dust, ash, and dried blood
- Face like **a flayed mask**, always staring
- Speaks rarely—**gives orders with gestures or one-word commands**

Wields a **curved edge-hammer**, forged from the ribs of a siege beast. It doesn’t cut—it **obliterates**. He leads with silence and force. When Takka enters battle, there are **no games**, **no warnings**, just crushed bodies and echoes.

> “Leave the corpses. Their gods know where to find them.”

### Maya – The Barrel-Queen

_Artillerist • Strategist • Sadist_

- Lean, quick, and **louder than thunder**
- Wears ammo like jewelry, trophies from kills
- Her face is split by an old shrapnel scar, and she’s proud of it
- Carries a full-sized **two-handed siege defense cannon**

She mocks while she fights. She laughs when she kills. She aims for **knees first**, so you’ll know you’re dying slow.

> “Tell the next world Maya sent you. Tell them I’m coming.”

### Culture & Behavior

- **They chant** in deep, rhythmic patterns—half-language, half-rallying cry
- They use **smoke flares** and **bone whistles** to coordinate attacks
- Their lair is **littered with plunder**:
  - Merchant banners, military wagons, shattered relics, traveler bones
- They keep **no written records**—just **trophies**, and **names carved into walls**

They are not misunderstood.  
They are not sacred.  
They are exactly what they look like:  
**the worst thing waiting at the edge of the world.**
