# Agamen, the Demon Who Hunts His Own

Agamen is a Silent One, coming from the Hidden Kingdom. He is now a creature that dwells in the Rifts that border the Wound and the remains of the slain sun god. Among his kind, he is an anomaly: disciplined, methodical, and bound to a purpose greater than himself.

That purpose is the Archivist—a neutral demon whose existence revolves around a single principle: to preserve knowledge, whether in the form of words, symbols, or the living and dead flesh of demons. In his vaults, bones breathe, tongueless mouths whisper, and memory is stored even in the hardened tissue of ancient creatures.

Agamen has been sent to the surface with a specific task: to make contact with Sartorius, a colossal demon-smith known not for destruction, but for his unexpected gentleness. Sartorius lives, and Agamen has not been sent to kill him. Instead, he is to negotiate the voluntary donation of flesh or bone—an offering to the archive. For the Archivist, documenting a living entity is a rare privilege, and the subject’s consent is a necessary part of that record.

This is not extraction—it is living preservation.

But beneath that official mission lies something else. Agamen is quietly searching for those willing to follow him beyond the Wound, to the far region of **Ordovica**, where he believes **Rubedo**, one of the Four Hiisi, still lingers. Weakened, perhaps, but not gone. Agamen hopes to claim a fragment of Rubedo—something tangible, something that can be catalogued before it disappears or awakens.

This journey is **unsanctioned by the Archivist**. He will only attempt it if he finds companions skilled—or mad—enough to join him.

He has heard rumors of a group of adventurers who once managed to neutralize **Xanthous**. He doesn’t take it as fact, but neither does he dismiss it. In Agamen’s eyes, **rumors are half-drawn maps**—unreliable, but directional.

> He offers no coin. No promises. No glory.  
> Only the path forward—into lands even demons fear to walk.

**Alignment:** _Lawful Neutral_  
**Disposition:** Detached, clinical, relentlessly focused  
**Philosophy:**  
Agamen does not hate or love. He does not judge or absolve.  
He archives. He preserves order through documentation.  
To him, existence has value only when it is recorded, understood, and classified.  
Everything else is noise.
