# Freeing Ukkonhemmo

Ukkonhemmo, the Stormfather, is impaled atop the Spire by three godslaying harpoons forged of tombsteel—cold, brutal instruments designed to pin even the divine.

These harpoons do not siphon his power. They simply hold him still. The winds still adore Apatheria. The vakis remain hers.

### Traits

- **Tombsteel Construction.** The harpoon is made of tombsteel—cold, dead matter honed from the vilest strain of Stachybotrys Ventralis, designed to end divinity. It is a null-magic material and cannot normally be affected by magic to alter it's shape or properties.
  **Grave Chill.**  
   When a creature hits the harpoon with a **melee weapon attack**, the attacker immediately takes **10 cold damage** as frozen rime shards erupt from the harpoon.

---

### Interactions

- **Disable Harpoon.** A creature adjacent to the harpoon may attempt to dislodge it.  
  This requires **3 successes before 2 failures** on DC 16 ability checks.  
  Valid options include:

  - **Athletics (Strength):** Wrench, lift, or twist the massive tombsteel shaft free
  - **Survival (Wisdom):** Exploit wind pressure, terrain cracks, or stress in the rock
  - **Performance (Charisma):** Call the storm vakis through wind-dance
    - The creature performs a rhythmic, meaningful movement to attract storm vakis that still adore Ukkonhemmo
    - **DC 18** (or **DC 15** if the performer has recently invoked wind, lightning, or thunder)
    - On success: counts as **1 success** toward disabling the harpoon
    - On failure: the creature takes **5 lightning damage** and may not use this method again on this harpoon

On each failure, the creature takes **5 thunder damage** and suffers **disadvantage on its next check** against that harpoon.

### Successful Intervention on the Harpoon

Each time a harpoon is successfully destroyed or disabled, the seal weakens and Ukkonhemmo begins to stir. The following effects occur based on the number of harpoons removed:

- **First Harpoon Freed**  
  One of Ukkonhemmo’s children divebombs Apatheria in a burst of furious wind and gliding silence. :

  Triggered when the **first harpoon is freed**

The creature targets any creature within **300 feet** of Ukkonhemmo—typically Apatheria or her mount—and makes a **Divebomb Strike**:

- _Melee Weapon Attack:_ **+15 to hit**, with **advantage**
- _Hit:_ **36 (6d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage** and the target is **knocked prone**
- If the target is already prone or flying, it instead takes **maximum damage (63)** and it's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn, as it reels in pain

The Silent One immediately takes off after the strike and **cannot be targeted** or interacted with—it is not a creature in play.

- **Second Harpoon Freed**  
  Ukkonhemmo exhales, and a surging gale of healing winds blasts out from his wounds, healing all of the creatures of his choice within 300ft.

  All creatures chosen by Ukkonhemmo regain **33 hit points**.
  Additionally, they may immediately stand if prone and remove one effect that reduces or restricts movement (e.g. grappled, restrained).

- **Third Harpoon Freed**  
  Ukkonhemmo is partially unbound. He cannot act, but his will surges visibly through the air.  
  Immediately trigger one [Blessings of the Storm God](/en/library/games/side-games/the-winds-of-borossa/blessings-of-the-storm-god) effect.
