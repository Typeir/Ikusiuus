# The Winds of Borossa

In the southern lands of Thule, on a **ruin-strewn, storm-torn, wind-blessed island** near the coast of Dhanas, lies the spire of **Ukkonhemo**, a site of worship by many a barbarian.

**Borossa** is **older than the Empyrean conquest—founded by migrants, a land of pirates, raiders, barbarians, and shamans**. This land carries wind in its blood. But recently, calm has overtaken the storms, and omens of those who live in the windless tunnels and grand cities below have started scouring the land: **armored specters unknown to the southern Thuleans, clad in raiments black and cold as the touch of death, or the starless sky.**

Soon after their arrival, the winds settled down for longer than a day—for the first time in millennia. Everywhere except the spire—the peak of what the Empyreans call **the Borealis**.

For reasons known only to you, you embark on a trip there. Along the way, you find yourself surrounded by new—or perhaps old—faces. In a different scenario, they might be enemies. But now, **beneath this strange and stilling sky, amid this windless, crying rain**, they are all you have left.
