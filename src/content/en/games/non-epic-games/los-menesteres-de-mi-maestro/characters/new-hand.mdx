# THE NEW HAND - LORE

_You joined the stead after a tough exam just two cycles ago. Barely a month.
You have been going on hunts with Aristides regularly. He gave you a key to the secondary pantry two days before he left.
You usually leave it in the entrance of the lower chambers, right before the locked door, since no one looks around there.
You do steal food from time to time. Although as of late, humidity spoils it so quickly you barely get a chance.
Aristides told you this would be your little secret, so you haven't told a soul._
