# THE SOLDIER - LORE

_You are in charge of keeping wildlife and bandits in check. Bandits have never shown up, but you have
had your fair share of encounters with boars and landsharks. A few nights ago, you heard a great roar in the
forest; you tried to track it and found curious prints you couldn't identify. You didn't think much of it at the time.
The prints led into the stead, so you assumed it had to have been a horse with untrimmed hooves._
