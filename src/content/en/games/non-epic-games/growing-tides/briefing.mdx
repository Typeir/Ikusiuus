# Morning Briefing: Oil Rig A255-3

**Location:** _Break Room, Oil Rig A255-3_  
**Time:** _Early Morning Shift_

**Attendees:** _Petrocles (Supervisor), Rig Crew_

---

In the cold, sterile light of the break room, Petrocles stood before the crew, his expression set in hard lines. The rig, known as A255-3, loomed around them like a towering specter in the mist, the machinery rumbling and clanking with a tired, mechanical rhythm. Petrocles, the recently hired superviros, regarded each worker with confused and unorderly swipes, before attemping to reform himself into the semblance of a propper leader.

“Alright, everyone-, listen up--,” he started, his voice trembling through the silence. “We have a situation on our hands. [YOUR MISSING COWORKER] was last seen down by the Lower Drills ---, around Well 2, late last night. He hasn’t reported back. You all know [YOUR MISSING COWORKER]’s not one to take off or shirk his work... Not that he could anyway, we're so far away from the coast you'd need weeks on a speedboat to reach shore... so we need to find out what’s keeping him.”

He glanced around the room, ensuring he had everyone’s attention. “Uh, That said, the work doesn’t stop. We’ve got a day’s worth of tasks to get through, and we’re already short a head. Each of you is responsible for your station—if you see anything out of place, or find any sign of [YOUR MISSING COWORKER], report back immediately. Understood?”

# **Assigned Tasks:**

- **Inspect Lower Drills:**

  "First task, I need at least two of you to head to the Lower Drills where [YOUR MISSING COWORKER] was last seen. Make sure there are no leaks or damage to Well 12. Keep your eyes open for any tools or personal items he might have left behind.”

- **Water Filtration Units Check:**

  "We’ve had issues with water contamination before, so I want one of you to ensure the filtration units are operational. If the filters look clogged, get them cleared. We’re not losing a single hour of productivity to something that can be fixed now.”

- **Fuel Reserve Inspections:**

  “Fuel reserves have been running hard. We don’t need any leaks or spillages, so double-check the reserve tanks. Look for anything that might be off, and if something’s out of line, bring it up right away.”

- **Rig Stability Test:**

  "This rig’s been shifting more than usual. You’ll go and make sure the supports are secure. If there’s any give in the structure, log it and bring it to my attention.”

- **Electrical Wiring Check:**

  "Several of you have reported a buzzing sound near the lower decks. I need a pair of hands to check the wiring; see if there’s a short circuit or anything that might need patching. Make sure the rig stays powered without interruption.”

- **Inventory of Tools and Equipment:**

  “[YOUR MISSING COWORKER] mentioned missing tools last week. I want an inventory on everything in storage. If anything’s gone, we need to note it down and lock up the rest. Last thing we need is missing equipment.”

- **Routine Maintenance on Central Pump:**

  “Check the central pump’s pressure levels. If there’s a spike or a drop in flow rate, flag it. We can’t afford to have that pump going out on us in the middle of a shift.”

- **Alchemical Precursor Storage Inspection:**

  "I need someone to head down to the lower bathysphere docks to check on the alchemical precursor storage. Those chemicals are volatile, and we can’t afford any leaks or contamination. Make sure all storage seals are intact and that the pressure indicators read normal. If anything seems off down there, report it right away and stay clear of the tanks."

Petrocles folded up his task list, looking around at the assembled crew, his expression momentarily tense before he spoke.

“One last thing,” he began, interrupted by the loud banging of a great wave crashing into the rig, the sea foam splattering up against the windows of the conference room, producing a horrendous thud against the glas - “There’s... uh, been some reports about the weather acting up out there... as you can see. Petrocles cleared his throat uncomfortably -And, well, some of the lower maintenance readings came back a bit... strange. You know, down by the supports, under the rig, where the lower shafts are.”

He cleared his throat, glancing toward the floor. “I want everyone to stay topside today. No in-person dive extractions—no reason to go down there, not in this weather. If we need to do extractions, we'll stay after-hours in the rig. There’s, uh, been a few spots with... potential material leaks too, so I’d rather you all just steer clear, alright?”

Petrocles’s gaze swept over the crew one last time, and he gave a quick nod. “Alright, that’s it. Be careful out there, and don’t hesitate to report anything unusual. Let’s keep things steady.”
