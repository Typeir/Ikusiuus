## Effects

**While wielding this shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.**

The shield has **5 charges**. When you are affected by a spell—whether it targets you directly, includes you in an area of effect, or requires a saving throw—you can use your **reaction** to expend a number of charges equal to the **spell’s level**. If you do, the spell is **reflected back at the caster**, who becomes the **sole target** of the spell, using their original attack roll or save DC against themselves.

- You must use the shield **before** the spell’s effects are resolved.
- If the spell originally had multiple targets or an area of effect (e.g. _fireball_), all other targets in the area are affected as normal; the spell is **centered on the original caster** or redirected appropriately.
- Spells that do not affect creatures (such as _teleport_ or _wall of force_) cannot be reflected.

The shield **regains 1d4 charges** each day at **dawn**. If you expend the last charge, roll a **d20**. On a **1**, the shield loses all magical properties, becoming a mundane +1 shield.

## Weapon Mastery ()

- **Push** _(Only available if the wielder has mastery with Warhammers)_:  
  After you successfully land an attack on a target, you can push that target up to 10feet away from you.

- **Wizard Fizzler** _(1/Short rest, or 3/Short rest if the wielder has mastery with Longswords)_:
  After you successfully land an attack on a target, you can deal an additional **2d4** force damage, and force the target to make a **DC 16** Intelligence saving throw, or become **unable to cast anything but cantrips** until the **end** of their **next turn**.
