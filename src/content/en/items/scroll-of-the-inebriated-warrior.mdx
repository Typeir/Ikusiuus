## Inebriation Tracker

Your mastery of inebriation has become an artform. You now track your **Inebriation Level**, which ranges from **0 to 36**.

- **Drinking alcohol** (such as a flask, bottle, or skin) counts as a **bonus action**, and increases your Inebriation Level by **1d6** (maximum 36).
- At the **end of each of your turns**, your Inebriation Level **decreases by 6**, unless you drink again.

## Hammered Sweet Spot: Inebriation Level 12+

While your Inebriation Level is **12+**, you gain the following benefits:

- You can make **one additional attack** as part of your **Attack action** (stacks with Extra Attack).
- Your **unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d4 force damage**, and deal extra damage equal to your **Wisdom modifier**.
- You have **advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics)** and **Charisma (Performance)** checks.
- You gain **+1 to AC** and **+1 to all Saving Throws**.

## Overdrunk & Exhaustion

As your Inebriation Level rises above 18, you begin to suffer the following effects:

| Inebriation Level | Effect                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 24                | Disadvantage on Wisdom checks and saving throws. |
| 30                | Gain **1 level of exhaustion**.                  |
| 36                | Gain **another level of exhaustion**.            |

You cannot exceed a level of 36. Your body simply cannot contain more.

## Sober Up

You can spend **1 ki point** and use an **action** to forcibly purge your alcohol and reset your Inebriation Level to **0**. When you do, you take **1d10 poison damage**, ignoring resistance and immunity. Alternatively, a **short rest** also resets the level and removes any exhaustion gained from this feature.
