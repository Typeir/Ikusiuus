# Bracers of Solar Might

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

These bracers are crafted from solidified **Torchtree sap**, a rare and volatile amber-like substance bled from the husks of parasitized **great trees** deep in the Brume. These strange trees sprout blazing leaves every few years, disrupting the natural night and day cycle across the land. The sap, when carefully refined, holds a fraction of that seasonal solar brilliance.

## Effects

- **Solar guidance**

  - Every day, **at sunrise**, the bracers regain their power.,
  - When you make an **attack roll**, you may **expend their power** to gain a **+10 bonus** to that roll.
  - This bonus **stacks** with other effects, but **only one bracer** can be expended per attack.

- **Stackable Infusion**  
  You may be attuned to **more than one** pair of Bracers of Solar Might. Each pair operates **independently**, with its own charge.

## Appearance

Forged from **translucent gold-orange resin**, the bracers shimmer faintly in darkness. Threads of old vine growth remain trapped within the sap, and **when a charge is expended**, the bracers briefly **pulse like a sunrise**, emitting a faint warmth.
