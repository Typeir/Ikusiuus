# Bag o’ Limbs

_Very rare (requires attunement)_
_Warhammer +1 (Melee, Heavy, Versatile, Magical Mastery: Push)_  
_Can be used as a spellcasting focus when attuned_

A disgusting, oversized sack of **preserved demon limbs**, grafted and stitched into a loosely humanoid form. Each strike carries the volatile essence of its contents — mangled hands, horns, tendrils, and organs — and channels the **residual elemental energies** from the demons they were torn from.

> That thing **reeks of incense, bile, and curdled demon sap**. Every time it moves, something squishes inside — sometimes it’s a knuckle, sometimes a lizard-like tongue. It’s a weapon **only a true Archivist** could wield with pride.- Cierto, Poet of Oblivion
