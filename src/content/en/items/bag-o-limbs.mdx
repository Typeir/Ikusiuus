# Bag o’ Limbs

_Warhammer +1_  
_Wondrous weapon, very rare (requires attunement)_

A disgusting, oversized sack of **preserved demon limbs**, grafted and stitched into a loosely humanoid form. Each strike carries the volatile essence of its contents — mangled hands, horns, tendrils, and organs — and channels the **residual elemental energies** from the demons they were torn from.

> That thing **reeks of incense, bile, and curdled demon sap**. Every time it moves, something squishes inside — sometimes it’s a knuckle, sometimes a lizard-like tongue. It’s a weapon **only a true Archivist** could wield with pride.- Cierto, Poet of Oblivion

## Effects

### Elemental Havoc

Whenever you hit a creature with **Bag o' Limbs**, roll a **d6** to determine a random elemental surge from the stored limbs. The target takes an additional **1d8 damage** of the rolled type, if the die lands on a 6, then rol two die and repeat, up to PB times:

| d6  | Elemental Effect |
| --- | ---------------- |
| 1   | **Fire**         |
| 2   | **Cold**         |
| 3   | **Acid**         |
| 4   | **Lightning**    |
| 5   | **Poison**       |

## Weapon Mastery

- **Push** _(Only available if the wielder has mastery with Warhammers)_:  
  After you successfully land an attack on a target, you can push that target up to 10feet away from you.

- **Limb Lash** _(1/Short Rest, or 3/Short Rest if wielder has Mastery with Greathammers)_  
  When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can activate one of the bound limbs to lash out wildly at nearby enemies.

- All creatures of your choice within **10 feet** of the target must make a **Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + Proficiency + STR modifier)** or take **2d6 bludgeoning + 2d8 random elemental damage** (roll on the table above).
- On a success, they take half damage and are not knocked back.
- On a failure, they are **pushed 10 feet away** from the target.
