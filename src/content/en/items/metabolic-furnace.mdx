# Metabolic Furnace

_(Monstrous Graft), legendary, nonmagical_

> “It’s awe-inspiring to see a beast able to wield metal-melting heat in absolute cold. It’s a dangerous challenge to face such a creature in combat — and an openly suicidal affair to fill your insides with its organs.”

This obscene monstrous graft dissolves your innards to fuel never-ending heat. Fuel the flame, consume the world.

## Attachment

Attaching this _major monstrous graft_ to a humanoid requires an **8-hour surgical procedure** using:

- **Alchemist’s Supplies**, **Surgical Tools**, and **Magical Healing** (one healing spell per failed check to stabilize the patient)
- A surgeon with **proficiency in Medicine** and the necessary tools.

During the procedure:

- The subject must succeed a **DC 10 Constitution saving throw** before **every Medicine check**.
  - On a failure, the subject’s body **permanently rejects** this graft.
  - If self-applied, they also **die instantly and violently**.

Each hour of the procedure requires a **DC 20 Medicine check**.

- On a failure, the subject takes **8d6 fire damage** and must **repeat the check**.
- If interrupted, the graft is **rejected permanently**.

- This graft is **permanent** until surgically removed (which destroys it).
- It is **nonmagical** in nature.
