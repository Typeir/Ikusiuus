# Metabolic Furnace

_Wondrous item (Monstrous Graft), legendary, nonmagical_

> “It’s awe-inspiring to see a beast able to wield metal-melting heat in absolute cold. It’s a dangerous challenge to face such a creature in combat — and an openly suicidal affair to fill your insides with its organs.”

This obscene monstrous graft dissolves your innards to fuel never-ending heat. Fuel the flame, consume the world.

## Attaching the Graft

Attaching this _major monstrous graft_ to a humanoid requires an **8-hour surgical procedure** using:

- **Alchemist’s Supplies**, **Surgical Tools**, and **Magical Healing** (one healing spell per failed check to stabilize the patient)
- A surgeon with **proficiency in Medicine** and the necessary tools.

During the procedure:

- The subject must succeed a **DC 10 Constitution saving throw** before **every Medicine check**.
  - On a failure, the subject’s body **permanently rejects** this graft.
  - If self-applied, they also **die instantly and violently**.

Each hour of the procedure requires a **DC 20 Medicine check**.

- On a failure, the subject takes **8d6 fire damage** and must **repeat the check**.
- If interrupted, the graft is **rejected permanently**.

- This graft is **permanent** until surgically removed (which destroys it).
- Only **one major monstrous graft** can be attached at any time.
- It is **nonmagical** in nature.

## Extreme Adaptive Catabolism

While attached to this graft, you are **immune to the effects of extreme cold and heat** (as per the _environmental rules_).

## Fuel for the Flames\*

The **Metabolic Furnace** has **12 charges**.

You can **restore charges by consuming fresh corpses** of:

- **Beasts, Monstrosities, Giants, or Humanoids**, dead **no more than 10 minutes** or **preserved magically/extremely cold**.
- **Medium creature**: +1 charge
- **Large creature**: +2 charges
- **Huge creature**: +4 charges
- **Gargantuan creature**: Fully restore charges

> **Consuming a corpse** takes **10 minutes per charge** and involves a **nightmare-inducing digestion** process.

**Bonus Action – Ignite Fuel**  
You may expend **2 charges** to gain **resistance to fire and cold damage** for **1 minute**.

## Unstable Wrath

While under the effects of _Fuel for the Flames_, you may unleash the furnace’s full potential:

**As a reaction when you take damage**, you may **activate Unstable Wrath**, which lasts until _Fuel for the Flames_ ends.

**During Unstable Wrath:**

- You gain **immunity** to **fire and cold damage**.
- Creatures that **touch you or hit you** with melee attacks within 5 ft. take **10 fire damage**.
- **Once per turn**, when you hit with an **attack**, you deal an **extra 15 fire damage**.
- At the **start of each turn**, you **lose 3 charges**.
  - If you reach **0 charges**, the effect **ends immediately**.
  - You can choose to end this effect early with a **bonus action**.
- At the **end of the effect**, you take **4d6 acid damage** per charge spent _(this damage is unpreventable)_ as your **organs dissolve into sludge**.
