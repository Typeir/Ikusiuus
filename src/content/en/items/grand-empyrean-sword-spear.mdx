# Grand Empyrean Sword-Spear

_Very rare (requires attunement)_
_Sword-Spear +1 (Martial, Versatile, Heavy)_

The Empyrean Empire knew no bounds, and so did its cruelty. After the old gods were felled, tombsteel swords, spears, and lances such as this were forged in the image of the _heaven-piercers_ that killed **Päimar**, the sun god. These weapons were designed to channel the icy cold of the Empyrean’s wrath, bringing swift death to their enemies.
