# Blessings of Yskeia

_Very rare (requires attunement)_  
_Longsword +1 (Versatile, Magical, Mastery: Firestorm) and Greatshield (AC +3)_  
_Can be used as a spellcasting focus when attuned_

These paired weapons were forged before the dawn of this time, when four were the stars which shone bright. Their purpose now lost to time, they now only echo a sense of protection and refusal.
