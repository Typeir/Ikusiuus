# Sacred Heresy

_Rare (requires attunement)_  
_Two-handed greataxe +1 (Heavy, Two-Handed, Mastery: Sap, Cleave)_  
_Counts as a pact weapon for warlocks who possess Pact of the Blade_

Forged from a slab of curdled demon-sap and a chunk of primordial wax, this axe radiates with heat and cold in equal measure. The wound it opens is real—but so is the mend.

> In the beginning, there was nothing. Then came the flames of the Engine. With them: disparity—heat and cold, light and dark, life and death, rot and bloom.

## Weapon Mastery

This dual blade has two masteries.

- **Sap** _(Only available if the wielder has mastery with Greataxes)_:  
  When you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has **disadvantage on its next Attack Roll** before the start of your next turn.

- **Cleave** _(Only available if the wielder has mastery with Greataxes)_:  
  When you hit a creature with a Melee Weapon Attack, you can immediately make a second Melee Attack Roll **against another creature you can see within 5 feet of the first**.  
  On a hit, the second target takes **damage equal to the weapon’s damage die only** (no modifiers).  
  This effect can occur **once per turn**.

- **Edge of Duality** _(1/Short rest, or 2/Short rest if the wielder has mastery with Greataxes)_:  
  As an action, you **hurl Sacred Heresy in a 30-foot line**. It cleaves through everything in its path before returning to your hand.

  - All creatures in the line must make a **Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier)**.

  - **Enemies** who fail take **4d10 slashing + 2d8 necrotic + 2d8 radiant** damage.
  - **Allies** who fail are instead **healed for 2d8 + your Strength modifier**.

  - **Leech Spiral**: You gain **temporary hit points equal to half the total amount of damage and healing caused**, rounded up.
