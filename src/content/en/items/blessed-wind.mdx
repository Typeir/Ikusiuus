# Blessed Wind

_Legendary (requires attunement)_
_Curved longsword +3 (Finesse, Melee, Versatile, Mastery: Vex)_

A blade forged from the very breath of the heavens, the **Blessed Wind** hums with an endless, unseen current. Those who wield it move as if guided by the storm itself, striking with a force that echoes beyond their own motion.
