# Alfanjón of the Crescent Moon

_Very rare (requires attunement)_  
_Curved longsword +1 (Melee, Finesse, Versatile, Mastery: Slow)_  
_Can be used as a spellcasting focus when attuned_

Forged from a sliver of condensed moonlight and the scale of a lunar wyrm, this crescent blade phases gently in and out of visibility, humming faintly under the stars. Its form is tailored for agile swordmasters whose grace intertwines with arcane instinct.

> “Crescent is the blade that kills, full is the moon’s embrace.”
