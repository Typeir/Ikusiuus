# Deep Dredge

*Rare (requires attunement)*
*Warhammer +1 (Melee, Versatile, Magical, Mastery: **Push** or **Slow** — see Weapon Mastery)*
*Can be used as a spellcasting focus when attuned*
*Counts as a **Graviturgy Wizard** spellcasting focus*

This rusty and deteriorated anchor is made out of a mixture of primordial wax and curdled demon sap, many parts have been replaced with traditional metallurgy, giving it a makeshift quality. 
Still, the core is still in invaluably perfect condition, much like the treasures hidden below the brine.

> “Anchored in time, irrecoverable. All which contacts the null within the brine shall forever carry the void of it's hollowed heart”

## Special Features

- **Whispers from the Murk:**
  When attuned, you are proficient with Deep Dredge, even if you are not proficient with Martial weapons or Warhammers.


- **Bite or Bludgeon:**
  The hammerhead can be **smooth** (maul) or **barbed** (harpoon). **When you make an attack with Deep Dredge, you decide its damage type** (bludgeoning or piercing) for that attack. The head visually shifts to match.

- **Anchor Focus:**
  While attuned, Deep Dredge **functions as a spellcasting focus** for your wizard spells and specifically counts as a **Graviturgy** focus.

## Effects

- **Magical Weapon:**
  Deep Dredge is a **+1 weapon**. You gain a **+1 bonus to attack and damage rolls** made with it, and attacks count as **magical** for overcoming resistance and immunity.

- **War Mage’s Weapon:**
  Deep Dredge **also functions as a Wand of the War Mage +1**: you gain a **+1 bonus to spell attack rolls and saving throws**, and your spell attacks **ignore half cover**.

- **Catapult Conduit:**
  When **you cast *catapult***, treat the spell as **cast one slot level higher** than the slot you expend.

  * This applies **even if the hurled object is Deep Dredge** (its 10-lb weight qualifies for *catapult*).
  * If **Deep Dredge** is the projectile, it **immediately returns to your hand at the end of the spell** (after resolving the impact), **if you choose**.
  * This benefit **doesn’t stack** with other effects that increase a spell’s slot level and **doesn’t change** the maximum level a spell can be cast at.

## Weapon Mastery

- **Push:** *(active when dealing bludgeoning damage, only available if wielder has Mastery with Warhammers)*
  On a hit, you can **push** the target **10 feet** away from you if it is no more than one size larger than you.
v
- **Slow:** *(active when dealing piercing damage, only available if wielder has Mastery with Warhammers)*
  On a hit, the target’s **speed is reduced by 10 feet** until the start of your next turn.

- **Undertow:** _(1/Short Rest, or 3/Short Rest if wielder has Mastery with Warhammers)_  
  When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can call upon the primordial brine pools to summon a grasping hand made out of dredge.
    - The target is immediately targeted by the [_Maximillian's Earthern Grasp_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:maximillians-earthen-grasp) spell, considering you the caster.
    - This does not use or consume your concentration, rather, the spell takes it's whole duration of one minute unless you're knocked unconscious or the effect is dispelled.
