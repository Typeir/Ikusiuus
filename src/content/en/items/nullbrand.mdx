# Nullbrand

_Legendary (requires attunement)_  
_Sword +4 (Versatile, Magical, Mastery: Sever, Vex)_  
_Cannot be copied, reforged, or recreated by any divine or arcane method._

---

This is the sword Wax left behind when he stepped down from Plato’s Tower. Forged from pure idea, Nullbrand was meant to end wars without being drawn.
But peace died. And the blade, abandoned in brine beneath the station, grew a vaki—not of violence, but of refusal.
Its form is **edgeless**—a monolithic blade of **terracotta** carved from an impossible mold.
It bears **no sharpness**, no runes, no glow. The **pommel is a serene bust of Plato**, face cracked with hairline fractures that never deepen.

> “Oh, to be forgotten.”

## Special features

- **Patronage** Nullbrand, or its Vaki, are a Warlock patron. They may only offer patronage to Hexblades or Pact of the Blade Warlocks.

- **Rust aura** Nullbrand quickly rusts any metal it touches, rendering it vulnerable to all damage. Nullbrand is made of primeval terracotta, and is thus immune.

## Effects

- **Mundanity**
  Nullbrand is **mundane**. It does not count as magical for any negative purpose, it also requires no mastery for it's mastery techniques to unlock.

- **Pristine Edge**  
  +4 to attack and damage rolls. Counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances.

- **Unbreakable**  
  Nullbrand is **unbreakable**. It cannot be destroyed by any means, and will not rust or corrode.

- **Death of Inertity**
  Nullbrand deals double damage to constructs, quadruple to objects.

- **Impossibility Field**  
  Nullbrand cannot be affected by **Identify, Detect Magic, Wish, Mending, Scrying, Legend Lore**, or any effect that targets objects or weapons. It does not register as magical.

- **Sheathed Conviction**  
  If you end your turn without attacking or casting:

  - Gain **+2 AC**
  - Gain **resistance to all damage from creatures that can speak**
  - Take the **Dodge action for free**

## Weapon Mastery

- **Sever** _(Requires Nullbrand Mastery)_  
  When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may dispel a magic effect on the target. The target must succeed on a **Charisma [RR] saving throw (DC = 12 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma modifier)**.
  Each creature may only be subjected to this effect once per day.

- **Vex**  
  When you **hit** a creature with this weapon, you gain **advantage on your next attack roll against that same target** before the end of your next turn.

- **Erosion** _(1/short rest, or 2/short rest if the wielder has mastery with Nullbrand)_

As an action, make a single melee weapon attack with advantage. On a hit, the target suffers normal damage and is marked with **Erosion**:

- **Erosion is a stacking curse**.  
   For each stack, roll **1d4** and subtract it to **all attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and AC**.
- The effect lasts until **_Greater Restoration_**, **_Remove Curse_**, or **Wish** is used.

**Erosion** is not magical—it is a curse, a mechanism of reality, not a spell. It **cannot be dispelled**, only removed by the listed effects.

## Battlefield Action – **Null and Void**

_(recharge at sundown)_

You swing Nullbrand in a still arc. The air breaks silently.
Nullbrand carves a **30-foot long, 5ft wide line** through space, dragging the blade in utter silence.

All creatures in that line must make a **Charisma [RR] saving throw (DC = 12 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma modifier)**.

- **On a failure**, the creature is **banished to the Muck Dimension**:

  - The creature is banished for as many rounds as points it failed the DC.
  - The creature becomes **incapacitated**, unable to take actions of any kind.
  - At the start of each of its turns, it takes **6d10 force damage** as it sinks through brine and pressure.

- **On a success**, the creature suffers **6d10 force damage** as its spatial integrity partially collapses.

---

**The Muck Dimension** is a microchamber within the folds of reality, a copy of the primordial rot-brine layer beneath Plato Station.  
Nullbrand’s vaki is native to the original one.

> Nullbrand does not shine.  
> It does not bleed.  
> It does not remember being held.  
> But it never forgets being dropped.
