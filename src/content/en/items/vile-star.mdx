# Vile Star

_Rifle +2_  
_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_  
_Heavy, Ranged (60/120), Special_

A speck of truth, granted to those who've been inflicted vileness â€” so they may return it to the world. This rifle bears a cruel elegance, its biomechanical structure constantly pulsing with latent poison and radiant sorrow. Each shot echoes with judgment.
