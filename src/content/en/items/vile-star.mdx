# Vile Star

_Legendary (requires attunement)_  
_Rifle +2 (Heavy, Two-Handed, Ranged 60/120, Special, Mastery: Slow)_  
_Can be used as a spellcasting focus when attuned_

A speck of truth, granted to those who've been inflicted vileness—so they may return it to the world. This rifle bears a cruel elegance: biomechanical veins pulse with latent venom, its barrel glows with restrained judgment. It does not fire bullets—it releases sentences.

> The dragon forgave not they who made him blind, why should I forgive the world, then?”
