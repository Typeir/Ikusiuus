# Carranza’s Great Épée

_Very rare (requires attunement)_  
_Rapier (1d8 piercing, Finesse, Special, Sap, Magical, Martial)_  
_Can be used as a spellcasting focus when attuned_

A **colossal estoc**, rigid and razor-thin, meant for graceful counters and punishing ripostes. Its sturdy frame parries even the mightiest strikes, while its design allows for lethal precision.

> “If I must die, let it be to my own reflection in your blade.”

## Weapon Properties

- **Type:** Rapier (Martial, Finesse, Special)
- **Damage:** 1d8 piercing
- **Weight:** Medium (not specified—same as standard rapier)

## Weapon mastery

- **Sap** _(Rapier Mastery)_:  
  When you hit a creature, their **next attack roll** before your next turn is made at **disadvantage**

- **Parry and Riposte** _(1/Short Rest, or 3/Short Rest with mastery)_:

  - When a creature makes a **melee attack** against you, use your **reaction** to force a **disadvantage reroll** (before result is known)
  - If the attack **misses**, you may **counterattack**, dealing an extra **1d8 lightning damage**
  - When targeted by a **ranged attack**, you may attempt to **redirect it**:
    - Roll a **Dex save (DC = max(10, half damage))**
    - **Fail**: You take normal damage (or ignore the miss)
    - **Success**: Redirect the attack at a target within **30/60 ft**; you roll attack and damage as if the original attacker had aimed for them

## Effects

- **Mighty Armament:**

  - Requires **20 Strength** to wield effectively; otherwise attacks are at **disadvantage**

- **Upkeep Penalty:**

  - After **1d4+1 encounters**, if not maintained, suffers **-5 to attack rolls**
  - Maintenance:
    - **10gp & 1 hour at a smithy**, or
    - **8 hours by a proficient alchemist/tinker**

  ### Fatebound Link

  A creature attuned to **Carranza’s Great Épée** cannot attune to **Narvaez’s Mighty Quiver**.  
  If both wielders are within **60 ft** of each other, they gain the following benefits:

  - **Ignore the Mighty Armament restriction**
  - **The Épée’s upkeep is suspended**—no maintenance needed
  - If the thread of fate is **severed**, these effects become **permanent**

  ***

  ### Fated Demise

  If the wielder of **Narvaez’s Mighty Quiver** is **unconscious or slain**, and the wielder of the **Épée** survives:

  - The quiver flies toward the épée wielder if within **600 ft**, traveling at:
    - **120 ft per round**, or
    - **60 ft per round through solid terrain**
  - The surviving wielder **automatically draws both weapons** (no action), treating them as **light**

  The wielder gains:

  - **Advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks**
  - **Immunity to all conditions** except **prone** and **exhaustion**
  - **1 level of exhaustion per round**

  If the fallen wielder is **revived**, the effects **end immediately**, but exhaustion persists.  
  The wielder may choose to **unbind** the weapons:

  - All magic in both items is **suppressed**
  - **1 exhaustion level is inflicted**
  - Both wielders **lose attunement**

  If the wielders are **separated by more than 600 ft**, the survivor gains **1 exhaustion per day at dawn** until the link is broken or restored.

  ### Retribution Mode

  While under **Fated Demise**, this weapon gains enhanced effects:

  - **Deflected Fate**_(3/Short Rest)_

  When you use **Deflecting Blade**, you may replace the usual redirect or counterattack with a **shockwave riposte**:

  - Every creature **within 5 feet of you** must make a **Dexterity saving throw**  
    (DC = 8 + Dexterity modifier + Proficiency bonus)
  - **On failure:** They take **2d8 slashing damage**
  - If the deflected attack was **ranged**, creatures make the save **with advantage**

  > If the thread of fate is severed, this ability becomes a **1-charge feature**, recharging **daily at noon**, instead of using short rest charges.
