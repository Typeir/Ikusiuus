# Scroll of the Storm Fist Technique

_Legendary, nonmagical_  
_Scroll_

> The giants were the first to learn the techniques of the storm bearers, their manuscripts a well-guarded treasure.
> This scroll is one of them—an original copy of the Electric Wind God Fist technique, known for punches that could split clouds and shatter canyons.

## Storm Fist Style

By internalizing the forbidden strikes of Ukko’s disciples, you permanently gain access to the **Electric Wind God Fist** technique.

- At the beginning of the round, you may now choose to apply **-5 to hit** to all **unarmed strikes** you make this round.
- If the attack hits, it deals **+10 damage**, and you may change the damage type to **lightning**.
- These lightning-infused strikes **ignore resistance to lightning damage**.

## Thunderous Precision

While using the Electric Wind God Fist Technique:

- Your **unarmed strikes critically hit on a roll of 19–20**.
- When you score a critical hit with an unarmed strike, roll **one additional damage die** of the same type.
- Each time one of these enhanced strikes lands, you may choose to **push the target 5 feet** away from you.

## Prerequisites

This scroll teaches a martial technique, not a spell.

You must be one of the following:

- A **monk**
- A **College of Dance bard**
- A character with the **Unarmed Fighting Style**
- A creature with **natural weapons** (such as claws, horns, or fangs)

Once read, the scroll **burns away in a gust of heatless wind**, leaving only faint ozone.
