# Venomous Appendages

_(Monstrous Graft), very rare, nonmagical_
_Natural Weapon (Finesse, Special)_  
_Martial, Melee, Magical_

This graft replaces a subject’s limbs and spinal musculature with **venom-conductive tissues** and **gland-laced extensions**, including **three articulated tails** and **reinforced clawed limbs**. Originally harvested from a **lunar manticore**, the appendages remain reactive and hostile to intrusion.

> Upon preliminary vivissection the subject demonstrates three autonomous appendages with stingers attached to a common gland. Nature knows that venom is an effective method, but giving three weapons to the same being is just inefficient depravity - Loterra, Praefectus Fabrum

## Attachment

Attaching this _major monstrous graft_ to a humanoid requires an **8-hour surgical procedure** using:

- **Alchemist’s Supplies**, **Surgical Tools**, and **Magical Healing** (a healing spell is required after each failed Medicine check)
- A surgeon with **proficiency in Medicine** and proper tools

During the procedure:

- The subject must succeed on a **DC 10 Constitution saving throw** before **each Medicine check**
  - On a **failure**, the subject **permanently rejects** the graft
  - If **self-applied**, they **die instantly and violently**

Each hour requires a **DC 20 Medicine check**

- On a **failure**, the subject takes **6d6 poison damage** and must repeat the check
- If the procedure is **interrupted**, the graft is **rejected permanently**

- Only **one major monstrous graft** can be attached at a time
- The graft is **nonmagical** and **permanent** unless surgically removed (destroyed on removal)
