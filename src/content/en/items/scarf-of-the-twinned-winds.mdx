# Scarf of the Twinned Winds

_Rare (requires attunement)_  
_Scarf/Cape (magical)_

This Cavari battle-scarf is woven from seekingsilk and the shattered silver Zülfikars of ancient duelists, each split-blade etched with mirrored invocations to fire and frost. In motion, the scarf unfurls like twin banners of an empire long buried beneath salt and sand—one burning, one still.

> “Let the east wind burn, and the west wind still.”
