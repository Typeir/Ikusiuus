# Narvaez’s Mighty Quiver

_Rare (requires attunement)_  
_Greatsword (2d6 slashing, Heavy, Two-Handed, Special: Thrown, Graze)_  
_Can be used as a spellcasting focus when attuned_

A quiver filled with **brutish, oversized greatswords**, crafted for **both melee and ranged devastation**. The enchantment allows the wielder to hurl these blades with unnatural ease, their arcs crackling with energy.

## Weapon Properties

- **Type:** Greatsword (Martial, Heavy, Two-Handed, Thrown (30/60), Special)
- **Damage:** 2d6 slashing
- **Weight per sword:** 6 lbs
- **Quiver weight:** 10 lbs

## Weapon mastery

- **Graze** _(Greatsword Mastery)_:

- **Thunderous Hurl** _(1/Short Rest, or 3/Short Rest with mastery)_:  
  As an **attack**, you may hurl a greatsword from the quiver at a target within **30/60 ft**:
  - All creatures in a **5 ft-wide line** between you and the target must make a **Dexterity saving throw**  
    (DC = 8 + Strength mod + Proficiency bonus)
  - **On failure:** They take **2d6 lightning damage**
  - **On hit:** Target takes an additional **2d6 thunder damage**, and their **speed drops to 0** until your next turn
  - The hurled greatsword **shatters on impact**

## Effects

- **Mighty Armament:**

  - Requires **20 Strength** to wield. Otherwise, attacks are at **disadvantage**
  - Holds up to **10 special greatswords**
  - Drawn blades lose **Heavy** and **Two-Handed**, but gain **Thrown (30/60 ft)** and **Brittle** (breaks on impact)

- **Weapon Compatibility:**

  - **Standard greatswords** suffer **-5 to hit** unless modified (5gp, 1 hour by smith)
  - **Magical greatswords** are **forcefully ejected** if placed in the quiver

- **Proficiency Override:**

  - While attuned, you gain **proficiency** with Narvaez’s quiver swords

  ### Fatebound Link

  A creature attuned to **Narvaez’s Mighty Quiver** cannot attune to **Carranza’s Great Épée**.  
  If both wielders are within **60 ft** of each other, they gain the following benefits:

  - **Ignore the Mighty Armament restriction** (Strength 20 no longer required).
  - **Greatswords stored in the quiver weigh 0 lbs** for carrying capacity.
  - If the thread of fate is **severed**, these effects become **permanent**.

  ### Fated Demise

  If the wielder of **Carranza’s Great Épée** is **unconscious or slain**, and the wielder of the **Quiver** is still alive:

  - The épée flies toward the quiver wielder if within **600 ft**, traveling at:
    - **120 ft per round**, or
    - **60 ft per round through solid terrain**.
  - The surviving wielder **automatically draws both weapons** (no action), treating them as **light** weapons.

  The wielder gains:

  - **Advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks**
  - **Immunity to all conditions** except **prone** and **exhaustion**
  - **1 level of exhaustion per round** until they fall unconscious

  If the fallen ally is **revived**, these effects **end immediately**, but exhaustion remains.  
  The wielder may choose to **unbind** the weapons, which:

  - **Removes all magic** from both items until **rebonded**
  - **Inflicts 1 level of exhaustion** (unless already at 5)
  - **Forces both wielders to unattune**

  If the wielders are **more than 600 ft apart**, the survivor gains **1 exhaustion per day at dawn** until the bond is restored or severed.

  ### Retribution Mode

  While under **Fated Demise**, this weapon gains enhanced effects:

  - **Storm Of Blades**_(3/Short Rest)_

  When you take the **Attack action**, you may **replace one of your attacks** with a casting of **Call Lightning**, where thunderous, lightning blades fall from the sky. This version works regardless of the sky visibility, as the blades manifest from your quiver:

  - You cast **Call Lightning** (DC = 8 + Strength modifier + Proficiency bonus) as though using a **5th-level spell slot**
  - The storm cloud appears **instantly** over the target (no 10-minute casting delay)
  - The spell uses **Strength** as your spellcasting ability
  - You may call the bolt **immediately** on the same turn
  - The spell requires no verbal, somatic, or material components when cast this way
  - The weapon becomes **supercharged** for 1 minute:
    - While Call Lightning is active, **drawn greatswords crackle**, dealing **+1d6 lightning damage** on hit

  > If the thread of fate is severed, this ability becomes a **1-charge feature**, recharging **daily at noon**
