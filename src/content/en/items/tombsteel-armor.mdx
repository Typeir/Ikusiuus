# Tombsteel Armor

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a creature proficient in heavy armor)_

---

## Description

Tombsteel was the hallmark alloy of the final Empyrean era—its cold silence a grim echo of that civilization’s decline. Forged for the **Demon-Hunting Knights** and the **Godslaying Battalions**, this armor is feared not for what it does, but for what it represents: the slow death of a world once governed by mechanical perfection.

Though nonmagical, the alloy is unnaturally dense and eternally cold to the touch. To wear it is to **entomb oneself in duty**.
