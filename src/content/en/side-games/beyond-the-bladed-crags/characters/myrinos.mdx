## Myrinos, the Cloud-Eyed

_Empyrean Elder • Bearer of Memory • Witness of the True World_

> “This is not the world. This is the dream of its apology. This world speaks with borrowed teeth, the real world is screaming in agony.”

### Who He Is

Myrinos is old in a way that makes time feel like a thin cloth draped over him. Once an Empyrean of standing, he is now no more than a **frail man**, walking with a cracked cane and a pack full of notes no one else can read. He does **not cast spells**. He has **no divine favor**, no tricks, no strength left in his limbs.

What he has is **knowledge**. Unstable, possibly dangerous knowledge.  
And memory that reaches **before the Clone Worlds**—to the time before the Canvas tried to fix what the White Homunculus and the Dreamcatcher broke. Before the fate of this world was sewn into the tree, the blade, and the abandoned, forgotten hero.

Myrinos knows of **Ordovica**.  
He claims to have seen it, to have lived below it, the forgotten astral goddess, it's corpse —**the hidden moon**, a wound wrapped in silence.

### On the Hidden Moon

Myrinos knows **Ordovica** well—not as myth, but as memory.  
It lies on the **far side of Damocles**, above the shattered lands of the Wound. The **moon** hangs directly over it, ancient and inert, fixed in place like a relic no one remembers how to worship.

He calls it **the lid that won’t lift**.

- “The moon doesn’t rise. It waits. It watches the gate we forgot we built.”

What lies **beneath the Wound**, however, is not the moon. It is **Thealas**—a place **almost unreachable**, hidden behind broken tunnels, collapsed histories, and the Empyrean systems that hunt memory as if it were prey.

Within Thealas is the only thing Myrinos fears: **the Device**.

He has seen it only once, and only from far away—**a machine so vast, so layered and unknowable**, that even describing it becomes a kind of heresy. It is not divine, not magical. It is **designed**—by hands long vanished, minds long erased.

He does not know what it does.  
He only knows it is **both gate and key** to the **True World**.

- “It does not turn for us.
- We are dust in its joints, dreams caught in its machinery.
- But if it notices you—just once—you might become part of its purpose.”

### How He Speaks

Myrinos is slow, deliberate. He pauses in the middle of sentences, not from confusion, but because **he’s listening**—to things no one else can hear.  
He often refers to people by the **role he sees them playing**, not their name.

- “You carry a decision in your mouth.”
- “You are a locked gate, but the wrong key is inside you.”
- “She walks like the Canvas is trying to remember her.”

He gives directions in metaphors:

- “To reach Ordovica, you walk until time forgets your name.”
- “Go down, until you are no longer sure what was up.”

### His Role Now

Myrinos appears first before the coup d'etat in the brume, then during the party's passage near the Bladed Crags. He does not approach immediately. He waits, watching. Eventually, he **asks to walk with them**, and they find it impossible to say no—not from magic, but from the sense that **he’s already been walking with them for some time**.

He tells them **there is a way** to reach **Ordovica**—a path that bypasses the dangers of the bladed crags.

He does not push them to follow. He simply walks **in the direction of the truth**, and speaks as he goes.

### Mechanics and Impact

- **Zero combat value.** He will die if caught in a fight.
- **Unshakable resolve.** Can walk through fear, illusion, and despair with clarity.
- **Knows forgotten passages**, particularly those leading deep into wound-tunnels, dead cities, or hidden access points.

### Final Notes

Myrinos is not a guide.  
He is a **witness**.  
And he has already seen the path the party will walk.  
He’s just trying to get them ready to **survive it**.
