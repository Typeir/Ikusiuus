# Session Primer: The Quiet Trials of Loterra and John Sunshine

_Exile signed in silence. Justice, embodied._

## Setting the Stage

After the sealing of **Xanthous**, aspirant **Maris Aurelios** rose to prominence. Mere hours later, the **High Magii** was assassinated. The Brumish nobility needed no proof—only opportunity.

Instead of confronting Maris directly, they moved to sever his influence. A quiet campaign of exile and erasure has begun, targeting those whose presence might sustain his reach. Among the first to fall are **Loterra** and **John Sunshine**.

## The Judges: The Abdicated

### Romulo & Remo

- Judges of the Brume, designated as **Abdicated**.
- The court has **abdicated its authority onto them**, making them **the sole carriers of judicial power** in these cases.
- In this capacity, they **do not deliberate**—they **enact**.
- They are not emissaries of the court. In these trials, **they are the court**.
- The sentence—**exile**—has already been signed. Their role is to deliver it, embodying the weight and finality of Brumean judgment.

## The Accused

### Loterra

- A brilliant **artificer**, known in hidden circles for **biomechanical experiments** that brush against heresy.
- His exile is a matter of **containment**, not punishment. The risk he poses is conceptual as much as physical.
- His compliance is not guaranteed.

### John Sunshine

- A public **icon of the Brumean military**, paladin of the Golden Ones.
- Admired widely, but **secretly working to bring down the Miracle religion**.
- His removal must be handled with surgical care—**clean, quiet, and deniable**.
- The court hopes he will not resist. It cannot afford what happens if he does.

## The Trials

- These are **not public hearings**. There will be no announcements, no transcripts, no audience.
- The sentence is **pre-determined**.
- The ritual of judgment is **for the record**, the exile for **stability**.
- What remains uncertain is how the accused will receive their fates—and whether **Romulo and Remo**, as the **Abdicated**, are willing to carry this judgment without being changed by it.
