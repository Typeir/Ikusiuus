# Oath of the Ancients

_Preserve Life and Light in the World._

The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the first elves.  
Paladins who swear this oath cherish life and light, valuing the beauty of the natural world more than rigid principles of honor or justice. They often adorn themselves with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to symbolize their connection to the living world.

**Tenets of the Ancients:**

- Kindle the light of hope.
- Shelter life.
- Delight in art and laughter.

## 3rd Level – Nature's Wrath

As a **Magic action**, you can expend one use of **Channel Divinity** to conjure spectral vines.

Each creature of your choice that you can see within **15 feet** must succeed on a **Strength saving throw** or become **Restrained** for **1 minute**.

A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
