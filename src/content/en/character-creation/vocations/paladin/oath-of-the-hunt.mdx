# Oath of the Hunt

_Hunt Without Mercy. End What Must Be Ended._

Paladins who take the Oath of the Hunt serve the Golden Ones, a militant order from the Brume. Their vow comes from the shattered remnants of the Päivätär faith. Once worshipped as the sun god of bounty, Päivätär grew spiteful and flooded the world with unchecked life. The Golden Ones harpooned the god in sacred rebellion.

The Hunt continues that pact. Paladins of this oath protect the balance by killing what needs to die.

## Tenets of the Hunt

The Hunt is not whispered—it is branded. These glyphs are seared onto the paladin’s upper arm:

- **Hone Your Weapons:** The Hunt tolerates no rust. Keep blade and instinct sharp.
- **Hunt Your Mark:** Mercy is hesitation, and hesitation is defeat.
- **Leave No Egg Behind:** The Hunt protects as much as it destroys. All things are born from cycle.
