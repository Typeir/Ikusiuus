# Paladin

Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred grove, or in solitude with the dead as witness, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond—turning a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

Paladins master weapons and armor but rely even more on divine magic to heal the injured, smite foes, and protect the helpless. Their life is one of adventure and cosmic struggle.
