# Oath of Devotion

_Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order._

The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to Justice and Order. These Paladins embody the archetype of the knight in shining armor, holding themselves—and sometimes the world—to the highest standards of conduct.

Many swear this oath before gods of law and goodness, while others revere angelic ideals, weaving symbols of wings into their armor and heraldry.

**Tenets of Devotion:**

- Let your word be your promise.
- Protect the weak and never fear to act.
- Let your honorable deeds be an example.

## 3rd Level – Sacred Weapon

When you take the **Attack action**, you can expend one use of **Channel Divinity** to imbue a **Melee weapon** you’re holding with positive energy.

For **10 minutes**, or until you use this feature again:

- Add your **Charisma modifier** (minimum +1) to **attack rolls** made with the weapon.
- Each time you hit, the weapon deals either its **normal damage type** or **Radiant damage** (your choice).
- The weapon emits **Bright Light** in a **20-foot radius** and **Dim Light** for an additional 20 feet.

You can end this effect early (no action required). It ends if you’re no longer carrying the weapon.
