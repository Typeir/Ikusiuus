# Arcane Trickster

_Enhance Stealth with Arcane Spells_  
Some Rogues enhance their finely-honed skills of stealth and agility with spells, learning magical tricks to aid them in their trade. Some Arcane Tricksters use their talents as pickpockets and burglars, while others are pranksters.

## Level 3: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you can use an Arcane Focus.

### Cantrips

You know three cantrips:

- [Mage Hand](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand)
- Two additional cantrips of your choice from the [Wizard spell list](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/wizard:spell-list).
- **Recommended:** [Mind Sliver](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:mind-sliver) and [Minor Illusion](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:minor-illusion).

At Rogue level 10, you learn an additional Wizard cantrip.  
Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one cantrip (except Mage Hand).

### Spell Slots

You use the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table for your spell slots. You regain all spell slots on a Long Rest.

### Prepared Spells

You prepare Wizard spells of a level you can cast. At level 3, you prepare three level 1 spells.  
**Recommended:** [Charm Person](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:charm-person), [Disguise Self](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:disguise-self), [Fog Cloud](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:fog-cloud).

When you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your prepared spells.

## Level 3: Mage Hand Legerdemain

When you cast [Mage Hand](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand):

- You can cast it as a Bonus Action.
- The hand is Invisible.
- You can control the hand as a Bonus Action.
- You can use the hand to make Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks.

---

## Level 9: Magical Ambush

If you are Invisible when you cast a spell on a creature, the creature has **Disadvantage** on any saving throw it makes against that spell this turn.

---

## Level 13: Versatile Trickster

When you use the **Trip** option of your Cunning Strike, you can also use that option on another creature within 5 feet of your [Mage Hand](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand).

---

## Level 17: Spell Thief

You can steal the knowledge of a spell from another caster.

When a creature casts a spell targeting you or including you in its area, you can take a **Reaction** to force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw (DC = your spell save DC).

- **On a failed save:** The spell has no effect on you, and you steal the spell if it is a level you can cast.
- You can cast that spell (it counts as prepared) for the next **8 hours**, and the creature cannot cast it again during that time.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
