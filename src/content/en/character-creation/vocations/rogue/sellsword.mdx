# Sellsword

- A blade for hire is a rogue in the most literal sense, no master but coin, stands their own ground by themselves in impossible encounters. Being outnumbered is but a quirk of the job to them. They cut through hordes and stand their ground like no other, but are quick to run when the job is done or ruined.

## 3rd Level – Blade of the land

- When you wield a **two-handed or heavy weapon** that deals **slashing or piercing** damage and **lacks the reach or special properties**. You may use Strength or Dexterity (your choice) for attack and damage rolls.
- You may use Sneak Attack normally with these weapons, and, additionally, you may also use it when at least **two hostile creatures are within 5 feet of you** —you do not need advantage or an ally. This works even if you rolled with Strength.

## 3rd Level – Press the Advantage

When you reduce a **creature to 0 HP** with a melee attack using a two-handed weapon, you may **immediately make another attack** with the same weapon against a **different creature** within reach.

- This follow-up attack is **part of the same action**.
- It does **not automatically grant Sneak Attack**.

## 9th Level – Bloodhail

When you kill a creature with a two-handed Sneak Attack, you may choose to refresh Sneak Attack for the next attack in the chain.

- This **allows you to apply Sneak Attack again**, even if you have already used it this turn.
- You may do this a number of times per **long rest** equal to your **Proficiency Bonus**.
- If the follow-up attack **misses**, **no uses** of this feature are **consumed**.

## 9th Level – Perseverance

When you reduce a creature to **0 HP with a Sneak Attack**, you gain temporary hit points equal to the number of Sneak Attack dice you rolled.

- You may use this feature a number of times per long rest equal to your Constitution modifier.

## 13th Level – Aggresive Footwork

When you use your Cunning Action to Disengage or Dash, you may **immediately attempt to shove** a creature as part of the **same bonus action**.

- This is an instant contested Athletics vs. Athletics/Acrobatics check.
- **No attack roll is needed**.

## 17th Level – Steel Mill

When a creature **enters or leaves your reach**, you may make a melee attack with your two-handed weapon against it.

- This does not consume a reaction.
- If the attack hits, you may move 5 feet as part of the same trigger. **This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks**.
- Each creature can only trigger this once per round.
- Sneak Attack cannot be used.
