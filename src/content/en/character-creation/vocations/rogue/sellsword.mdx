## 3rd Level – Blade of the land

- When you wield a two-handed or heavy weapon that deals slashing or piercing damage and lacks the reach or special properties. You may use Strength or Dexterity (your choice) for attack and damage rolls.
- You may use Sneak Attack with these weapons when at least two hostile creatures are within 5 feet of you—you do not need advantage or an ally. This works even if you rolled with strength.
