# Soulknife

_Strike Foes with Psionic Blades_

A Soulknife strikes with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These Rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. As a Soulknife your psionic abilities might have haunted you since childhood, revealing their full potential only as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out an order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.

## Level 3: Psionic Power

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself, represented by your **Psionic Energy Dice**.

| Rogue Level | Die Size | Number |
| ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| 3           | d6       | 4      |
| 5           | d8       | 6      |
| 9           | d8       | 8      |
| 11          | d10      | 8      |
| 13          | d10      | 10     |
| 17          | d12      | 12     |

You regain all expended dice after a Long Rest, and one die after a Short Rest.

### Psi-Bolstered Knack

When you fail an ability check using a skill or tool you’re proficient with, roll a Psionic Energy Die and add it. You only expend the die if this turns the failure into success.

### Psychic Whispers

As a **Magic action**, choose a number of creatures you can see (up to your Proficiency Bonus) and roll a Psionic Energy Die. For that many hours, you and the chosen creatures can communicate telepathically within 1 mile. No action is required to send or receive messages. A creature can end the connection at any time.

## Level 3: Psychic Blades

When you take the **Attack action** or make an **Opportunity Attack**, you can manifest a **Psychic Blade**:

- **Weapon Category:** Simple Melee
- **Damage:** 1d6 Psychic + modifier
- **Properties:** Finesse, Thrown (60/120 feet), Mastery: Vex (doesn’t count against your limit)

The blade vanishes immediately after the attack resolves.

After attacking with one blade, you can manifest and attack with a **second blade** as a **Bonus Action** (if your other hand is free). The second blade deals 1d4 Psychic damage instead of 1d6.

## Level 9: Soul Blades

You gain the following abilities:

### Homing Strikes

If you miss with a Psychic Blade, roll a Psionic Energy Die and add it to the attack roll. If this causes a hit, the die is expended.

### Psychic Teleportation

As a **Bonus Action**, you can manifest a Psychic Blade, expend a Psionic Energy Die, and throw it at an unoccupied space you can see within **10 × the die roll** feet. You teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.

## Level 13: Psychic Veil

As a **Magic action**, you become **Invisible** for 1 hour or until you:

- Deal damage to a creature, or
- Force a creature to make a saving throw

You can use this feature once per Long Rest. You can regain its use early by expending a Psionic Energy Die (no action required).

---

## Level 17: Rend Mind

When you deal **Sneak Attack** damage with your Psychic Blades, you can force the target to make a **Wisdom saving throw** (DC = 8 + Dex mod + Proficiency Bonus).

On a failed save, the target is **Stunned** for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on success.

You can use this feature once per Long Rest, or you can regain its use by expending **3 Psionic Energy Dice** (no action required).
