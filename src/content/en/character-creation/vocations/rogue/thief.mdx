# Thief

_Hunt for Treasure as a Classic Adventurer_

A mix of burglar, treasure hunter, and explorer, you are the epitome of an adventurer. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you gain abilities useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum benefit from the magic items you find there.

## Level 3: Fast Hands

As a **Bonus Action**, you can do one of the following:

- **Sleight of Hand.** Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with Thieves' Tools, or to pick a pocket.
- **Use an Object.** Take the Utilize action, or take the Magic action to use a magic item that requires an action.

## Level 3: Second Story Work

You've trained to get into especially hard-to-reach places, granting you these benefits:

- **Climber.** You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.
- **Jumper.** You can determine your jump distance using Dexterity rather than Strength.

## Level 9: Supreme Sneak

You gain the following **Cunning Strike** option:

## Level 13: Use Magic Device

You've learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting the following benefits:

- **Attunement.** You can attune to up to **four magic items** at once.
- **Charges.** Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of **6**, you use the property without expending the charges.
- **Scrolls.** You can use any _Spell Scroll_, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell.
  - For cantrips and level 1 spells, you cast it reliably.
  - For higher-level spells, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 + spell level). On success, you cast the spell. On failure, the scroll disintegrates.
