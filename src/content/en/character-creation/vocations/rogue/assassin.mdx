# Assassin

_Practice the Grim Art of Death_  
An Assassin’s training focuses on stealth, poison, and disguise to eliminate foes with deadly efficiency. While some Rogues who follow this path are hired killers, spies, or bounty hunters, these capabilities are equally useful for adventurers facing monstrous enemies.
