# Bard

Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are experts at inspiring others, soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creating illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spoken into existence, and that remnants of the Words of Creation still resound and shimmer across every plane. Bardic magic attempts to harness these words, transcending any language.

Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They become masters of performance, magic, lore, and storytelling. A Bard’s life is spent traveling, gathering knowledge, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences. Their depth of knowledge and magical expertise set them apart.
