# College of Lore

_Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge._

Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales. Lore Bards gather in libraries and universities to share knowledge. They also meet at festivals and affairs of state, where they expose corruption, unravel lies, and satirize figures of authority.
