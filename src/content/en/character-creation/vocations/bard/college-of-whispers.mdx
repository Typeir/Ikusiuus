# College of Whispers

_Secrets Carried in Song, Blades Hidden in Words._

Bards of the College of Whispers are wolves among sheep. They pose as entertainers, singers, and storytellers, but in truth, they learn the art of manipulation, blackmail, and terror. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.

Other bards despise the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that exploits the bardic reputation for personal gain. For this reason, Whispers Bards rarely reveal their true college, instead claiming to follow other traditions as they infiltrate courts and seats of power.

## 3rd Level – Words of Terror

You can **speak to a creature for at least 1 minute** and attempt to seed paranoia into its mind. The creature **has to be able to understand you**.

At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **Spell Save DC** or become **Frightened of you or another creature of your choice** for **1 hour**, until it is **attacked or damaged**, or until it **witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged**.

If Frightened, the target can’t willingly move closer to you, and has disadvantage on Charisma checks against you.

If the target succeeds, it has **no hint** that you tried to frighten it.

You can use this feature **once per short or long rest**.

## 6th Level – Mantle of Whispers

When a **creature dies within 30 feet of you**, you can use your **Reaction** to **capture its shadow** magically. You retain this shadow until you use it or until you finish a **long rest**.

You can use the shadow as an **Action**. When you do, the shadow vanishes, magically transforming into a **disguise** that makes you look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for **1 hour** or until you end it as a **Bonus Action**.

While in disguise, you gain access to all information the creature would **freely share with a casual acquaintance**. This includes general details about its background and personal life but **does not include secrets**.

Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a **Wisdom (Insight) check** with disadvantage aginst your passive **Charisma (Deception) check**. You gain a **+5 bonus** to your Deception check.

Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you cannot capture another until you finish a **short or long rest**.

## 14th Level – Shadow Lore

As an **Action**, you magically **whisper a phrase** that only **one creature of your choice within 30 feet** can hear.

- The target must make a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **Spell Save DC**.
- It **automatically succeeds** if it **does not share a language with you** or if it **cannot hear you**.

On a **successful save**, the whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has **no effect**.

On a **failed save**, the creature is **Charmed** by you for **8 hours**, or until you or your allies **attack or damage it**.

While charmed, the target believes you **know its most mortifying secret**. It obeys your commands for fear you will reveal the secret. It **won’t risk its life** or **fight for you**, unless it was already inclined to do so.

After the effect ends, the creature has **no memory** of why it feared you.

You can use this feature **once per short rest**.
