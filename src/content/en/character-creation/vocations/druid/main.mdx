# Druid

Druids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction.

Revering nature above all, Druids unite to mark the passage of the seasons and safeguard the delicate balance of life.
