# Circle of the Sea

_Become One with Tides and Storms._

Druids of the Circle of the Sea channel the tempestuous forces of oceans and storms. Some view themselves as nature’s wrath, punishing those who despoil the wilds. Others seek unity with the sea, listening to the currents, the winds, and the tide’s eternal ebb and flow.
