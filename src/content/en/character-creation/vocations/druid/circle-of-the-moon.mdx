# Circle of the Moon

_Adopt Animal Forms to Guard the Wilds._

Druids of the Circle of the Moon draw on lunar magic to transform themselves. Their order gathers under the moon to share news and perform rituals.

Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth as a bear to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the Druid’s blood.

## 3rd Level – Circle Forms

When you assume a **Wild Shape**, you channel lunar magic, gaining the following benefits:

- **Challenge Rating:** Maximum CR of the Beast form equals **your Druid level ÷ 3 (round down)**.
- **Armor Class:** Your AC becomes **13 + your Wisdom modifier** if this is higher than the Beast’s normal AC.
- **Temporary Hit Points:** Gain **Temporary Hit Points equal to 3 × your Druid level**. These last until you leave the form.
