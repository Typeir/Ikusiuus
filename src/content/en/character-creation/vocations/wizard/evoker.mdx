# Evoker

_Create Explosive Elemental Effects_

Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some Evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from afar. Others use their power to protect allies, while some seek personal gain.

## Level 3: Evocation Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation school of level 2 or lower and add them to your spellbook for free.

Additionally, whenever you gain access to a new spell level, you can add one Evocation spell of that level to your spellbook for free.

## Level 3: Potent Cantrip

Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the creature succeeds on a saving throw, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any), but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

## Level 6: Sculpt Spells

You can create pockets of safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to **1 + the spell's level**. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

## Level 10: Empowered Evocation

When you cast an Evocation spell, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

## Level 14: Overchannel

You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of level 1–5 that deals damage, you can choose to deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do this, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, you take **2d12 Necrotic damage per level of the spell slot** immediately after casting the spell. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.

Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by **1d12**.
