# Wizard

Wizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic's inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.

The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

As a Wizard, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Wizard levels. These features are listed in the Wizard Features table.

## Wizard Class Features

As a Wizard, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Wizard levels. These features are listed in the Wizard Features table.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the [Wizard spell list](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/wizard:spell-list).

**Cantrips.** You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light, Mage Hand, and Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

At Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard Features table.

**Spellbook.** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting _Identify_. The book's appearance is up to you.

The book begins with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. The following spells are recommended: [Detect Magic](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic), [Feather Fall](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:feather-fall), [Mage Armor](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:mage-armor), [Magic Missile](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:magic-missile), [Sleep](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:sleep), and [Thunderwave](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:thunderwave).

Whenever you gain a level in this class after 1st, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spell Slots.** The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare a list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast. Choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

As you gain Wizard levels, the number of prepared spells increases, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from your spellbook. For example, if you are a 3rd-level Wizard, you can prepare six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

Spells granted by other Wizard features do not count against the number of spells you can prepare.

**Changing Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells by selecting new spells from your spellbook.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for Wizard spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a spellcasting focus for Wizard spells.

#### Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook

The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research. You can also add other spells you find during your adventures.

##### Copying a Spell into the Book

When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it is of a level you can prepare and you have time to copy it. The process takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP per spell level.

##### Copying the Book

You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This process is faster because you already know the spell. It takes 1 hour and costs 10 GP per spell level.

If you lose your spellbook, you can transcribe the Wizard spells you have prepared into a new book using this procedure. The remainder of the new book must be filled out by finding new spells. Many Wizards keep a backup spellbook.

### Level 1: Ritual Adept

You can cast a spell as a Ritual if it has the Ritual tag and is in your spellbook. You don’t need to have it prepared.

---

### Level 1: Arcane Recovery

Once per day when you finish a Short Rest, you can recover expended spell slots equal to half your Wizard level (rounded up), excluding 6th level or higher.

---

### Level 2: Scholar

Choose one of your skill proficiencies from: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You gain **Expertise** in that skill.

---

### Level 3: Arcane Tradition

Choose a Wizard subclass:  
[Abjurer](/en/library/character-creation/vocations/wizard/abjurer)  
[Diviner](/en/library/character-creation/vocations/wizard/diviner)  
[Evoker](/en/library/character-creation/vocations/wizard/evoker)  
[Illusionist](/en/library/character-creation/vocations/wizard/illusionist)
[Incense](/en/library/character-creation/vocations/wizard/incense)

You gain subclass features at levels 3, 6, 10, and 14.

---

### Level 4, 8, 12, 16: Ability Score Improvement

Gain the [Ability Score Improvement feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:ability-score-improvement) or another [feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all).

---

### Level 5: Memorize Spell

After a Short Rest, you can replace one prepared spell with a different spell from your spellbook.

---

### Level 18: Spell Mastery

Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook with a casting time of 1 action. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot.

You can change these spells after a Long Rest.

---

### Level 19: Epic Boon

Gain an [Epic Boon feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all). [Boon of Spell Recall](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:boon-of-spell-recall) is recommended.

---

### Level 20: Signature Spells

Choose two level 3 spells as your signature spells. You always have these prepared and can cast each of them **once per day without expending a spell slot**.

After using this feature, you must finish a Short or Long Rest to regain the free use. You can still cast the spells with spell slots as normal.
