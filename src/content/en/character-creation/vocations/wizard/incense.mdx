# Order of Incense

Wizards of the Order of Incense blend martial might with brutal close-quarters spellcasting. They wield heavy weapons, wear armor, and conjure deathly miasmas of magical smoke, tearing the life essence from enemies while breaking enemy lines.

Most incense wizards serve noble roles as hag hunters or magical instructors. Others pursue darker paths, using their death magic to seek lichdom.

### 2nd level - Weaves of Incense

When you kill a creature that is threatening you with a leveled spell, a miasma of magical incense appears in the space the creature occupied. The miasma is the size of the creature killed, lightly obscures objects within and behind it, and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus.

The miasma is dissipated by gusts of wind, weather effects such as rain or hail, or attacks against it. Helping a creature within a miasma also dissipates it.

**Absorbing the Miasma.**  
As a reaction, when a miasma appears or when you move within 30 feet of one, you can attempt to absorb its lingering magic. Roll a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + twice the level of the spell slot expended to kill the creature). On a success, you regain one spell slot of a level up to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). You cannot regain a slot of higher level than the spell that spawned the miasma. These regained slots can only be used for Wizard spells.

### 6th level - Clad in Magic

You can weave your magic into armor as part of a long rest. Choose one piece of medium or heavy armor and attach scrolls and incense to it. While wearing this armor:

- You can see normally in magical darkness and mists that you create.
- The armor counts as a Wizard spellcasting focus for you.
- Your miasmas now heavily obscure areas if you are wearing this armor.

Additionally, when you cast a cantrip that includes a melee weapon attack, you can use your Intelligence modifier in place of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls.

### 10th level - Barrage Through the Smoke

When you harm a creature within 5 feet of you with a spell on your turn, you can use a bonus action to cast a cantrip targeting a creature within 5 feet of you. The creature harmed by your spell is a valid target.

Additionally, when you succeed on a saving throw from **Weaves of Incense**, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wizard level. These temporary hit points last until the end of your next long rest.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. All expended uses are regained when you finish a long rest.

### 14th level -Fog of Death

At , you gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws due to your constant exposure to magical miasma.

Your miasma also becomes a vector of poison and death:

- Creatures other than you that start their turn within one of your miasmas take necrotic or poison damage (your choice) equal to your Intelligence modifier.
