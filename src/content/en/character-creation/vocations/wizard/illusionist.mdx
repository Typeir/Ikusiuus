# Illusionist

_Weave Subtle Spells of Deception_

You specialize in magic that dazzles the senses and tricks the mind. The illusions you craft make the impossible seem real.

## Level 3: Illusion Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Illusion school of level 2 or lower and add them to your spellbook for free.

Additionally, whenever you gain access to a new spell level, you can add one Illusion spell of that level to your spellbook for free.

## Level 3: Improved Illusions

- You can cast Illusion spells without providing Verbal components.
- If an Illusion spell you cast has a range of **10 feet or more**, its range increases by **60 feet**.
- You know the [Minor Illusion](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:minor-illusion) cantrip. If you already know it, you learn a different Wizard cantrip of your choice. This cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.
- You can create **both a sound and an image** with a single casting of Minor Illusion.
- You can cast Minor Illusion as a **Bonus Action**.

## Level 6: Phantasmal Creatures

You always have **Summon Beast** and **Summon Fey** prepared.

Whenever you cast either spell, you can choose to change its school to Illusion, causing the summoned creature to appear spectral.

- You can cast the **Illusion version** of either spell **without expending a spell slot**, but doing so halves the summoned creatureâ€™s Hit Points.
- Once you cast either spell in this way, you must finish a Long Rest before you can do so again.

## Level 10: Illusory Self

When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can take a **Reaction** to interpose an illusory duplicate of yourself. The attack **automatically misses**, and the illusion dissipates.

- Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a **Short or Long Rest**.
- You can also restore your use of it by expending a **level 2+ spell slot** (no action required).

## Level 14: Illusory Reality

You have learned to weave shadow magic into your illusions, giving them semi-reality.

When you cast an Illusion spell with a spell slot, you can use a **Bonus Action** to choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make it **real**.

- The object remains real for **1 minute**.
- It **cannot deal damage** or **cause conditions**.
- For example, you could create an illusory bridge over a chasm, make it real, and cross it.
