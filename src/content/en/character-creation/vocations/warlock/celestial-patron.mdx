# Celestial Patron

_Call on the Power of the Heavens_

Your pact draws on the Upper Planes, the realms of everlasting bliss. You might enter an agreement with an empyrean, a couatl, a sphinx, a unicorn, or another heavenly entity. Or you might call on numerous such beings as you pursue goals aligned with theirs. Your pact allows you to experience a hint of the holy light that illuminates the multiverse.

## Level 3: Celestial Spells

When you reach a Warlock level specified in the Celestial Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Healing Light

You can channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s equal to 1 plus your Warlock level.

As a Bonus Action, you can heal yourself or one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, expending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can expend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you expend and restore Hit Points equal to the total. You regain all expended dice when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 6: Radiant Soul

Your link to your patron allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You gain **Resistance** to Radiant damage. Once per turn, when you cast a spell that deals Radiant or Fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to the damage against one of the spell's targets.

## Level 10: Celestial Resilience

Whenever you use your **Magical Cunning** feature or finish a Short or Long Rest, you gain **Temporary Hit Points** equal to your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.

Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see when you gain these points. Each creature gains Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.

## Level 14: Searing Vengeance

When you or an ally within 60 feet is about to make a Death Saving Throw, you can unleash radiant energy to save the creature. The creature regains Hit Points equal to half its Hit Point maximum and can end the **Prone** condition on itself.

Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of the creature takes **Radiant** damage equal to 2d8 plus your Charisma modifier and gains the **Blinded** condition until the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
