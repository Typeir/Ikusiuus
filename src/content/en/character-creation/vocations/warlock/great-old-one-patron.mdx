# Great Old One Patron

_Unearth Forbidden Lore of Ineffable Beings_

When you choose this subclass, you might bind yourself to an unspeakable being from the Far Realm or an elder god—a being such as Tharizdun, the Chained God; Zargon, the Returner; Hadar, the Dark Hunger; or Great Cthulhu. Or you might invoke several entities without yoking yourself to one. The motives of these beings are incomprehensible, and the Great Old One might be indifferent to your existence. But the secrets you’ve learned nevertheless allow you to draw strange magic from it.

## Level 3: Awakened Mind

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically while within a number of miles equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Warlock level. It ends early if you use this feature to connect with a different creature.

## Level 3: Great Old One Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Warlock level specified in the Great Old One Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Psychic Spells

When you cast a Warlock spell that deals damage, you can change its damage type to Psychic.

In addition, when you cast a Warlock spell that is an Enchantment or Illusion, you can do so without Verbal or Somatic components.

## Level 6: Clairvoyant Combatant

When you form a telepathic bond with a creature using your Awakened Mind, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save:

- The creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- You have Advantage on attack rolls against that creature for the duration of the bond.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

## Level 10: Eldritch Hex

You always have the [Hex](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:hex) spell prepared. When you cast Hex and choose an ability, the target also has Disadvantage on saving throws of the chosen ability for the spell's duration.

## Level 10: Thought Shield

- Your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it.
- You have Resistance to Psychic damage.
- Whenever a creature deals Psychic damage to you, it takes the same amount of damage that you take.

## Level 14: Create Thrall

When you cast [Summon Aberration](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:summon-aberration), you can modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If you do so:

- The spell's duration becomes 1 minute.
- The Aberration has Temporary Hit Points equal to your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.

In addition, the first time each turn the Aberration hits a creature under the effect of your [Hex](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:hex), it deals extra Psychic damage equal to the bonus damage of that spell.
