# Warlock

Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron.

Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power. Warlocks view their patrons as resources—means to an end. Some respect or even love their patrons, while others serve grudgingly or seek to undermine them.

Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for power and knowledge often leads to adventure.

## Class Features

### Level 1: Eldritch Invocations

At 1st level, you learn one [Eldritch Invocation](/en/library/character-creation/vocations/warlock/eldritch-invocation), such as **Pact of the Tome** or **Pact of the Blade**. You gain additional invocations as you level, as shown in the table.

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one invocation you know with another for which you qualify.

### Level 1: Pact Magic

Through occult ceremony, you’ve formed a pact with a mysterious entity. This gives you access to **Pact Magic**—a unique form of spellcasting.

- **Cantrips:** You know two Warlock cantrips. [Eldritch Blast](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:eldritch-blast) and [Prestidigitation](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:prestidigitation) are recommended.
- **Spell Slots:** You have a small number of spell slots, which recharge on a Short or Long Rest. All slots are the same level.
- **Prepared Spells:** You prepare Warlock spells of a level no higher than your current slot level. For example, at level 5, you prepare spells of levels 1–3, casting them as 3rd-level spells.
- **Spellcasting Ability:** Charisma.
- **Spellcasting Focus:** An Arcane Focus.

### Level 2: Magical Cunning

Once per Long Rest, you can perform a 1-minute ritual to regain half your Pact Magic spell slots (round up).

### Level 3: Warlock Subclass

Choose one patron subclass:

| Patron                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Archfey Patron](/en/library/character-creation/vocations/warlock/archfey-patron)             |
| [Celestial Patron](/en/library/character-creation/vocations/warlock/celestial-patron)         |
| [Fiend Patron](/en/library/character-creation/vocations/warlock/fiend-patron)                 |
| [Great Old One Patron](/en/library/character-creation/vocations/warlock/great-old-one-patron) |

---

## Pact of the Blade

At 3rd level, you can select **Pact of the Blade** as an Eldritch Invocation. This invocation allows you to:

- Summon or bond with a weapon.
- Use your Charisma for attack and damage rolls with it.
- Change the weapon’s damage type to Necrotic, Psychic, Radiant, or keep its original type.
- Use it as a Spellcasting Focus.

Additional blade-related invocations include **Thirsting Blade**, **Devouring Blade**, and **Eldritch Smite**.

---

### Level 9: Contact Patron

You can cast [Contact Other Plane](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:contact-other-plane) to communicate directly with your patron without risk of psychic damage. Once per Long Rest, you can cast it without a spell slot.

---

### Mystic Arcanum

At level 11, you gain a **Mystic Arcanum**—a powerful spell you can cast once per day without using a spell slot. You gain additional Arcanum spells at levels 13, 15, and 17 (7th, 8th, and 9th-level spells).

---

### Level 20: Eldritch Master

At level 20, using **Magical Cunning** now restores **all** Pact Magic spell slots.
