# Archfey Patron

_Bargain with Whimsical Fey_

Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.

## Level 3: Archfey Spells

When you reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Steps of the Fey

You can cast [Misty Step](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:misty-step) without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

Whenever you cast _Misty Step_, you can choose one of the following additional effects:

- **Refreshing Step.** You or one creature you can see within 10 feet gains 1d10 Temporary Hit Points.
- **Taunting Step.** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = your spell save DC) or have **Disadvantage** on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

## Level 6: Misty Escape

You can cast _Misty Step_ as a Reaction in response to taking damage.

Additionally, you gain two new options for Steps of the Fey:

- **Disappearing Step.** You gain the **Invisible** condition until the start of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or cast a spell.
- **Dreadful Step.** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d10 **Psychic** damage.

## Level 10: Beguiling Defenses

You are immune to the **Charmed** condition.

Additionally, when a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to halve the damage and force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = your spell save DC). On a failed save, the attacker takes **Psychic** damage equal to the damage you took. You can use this feature once per Long Rest, or restore it by expending a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required).

## Level 14: Bewitching Magic

Immediately after you cast an **Enchantment** or **Illusion** spell using an Action and a spell slot, you can cast _Misty Step_ as part of the same Action and without expending a spell slot.
