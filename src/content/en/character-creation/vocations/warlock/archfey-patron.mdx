# Archfey-Patron

_Bargain with Whimsical Fey_

Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.

### Level 3: Archfey Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### Level 3: Steps of the Fey

Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast [Misty Step](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:misty-step) without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following additional effects.

**Refreshing Step.** Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains 1d10 Temporary Hit Points.

**Taunting Step.** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have Disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

### Level 6: Misty Escape

You can cast [Misty Step](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:misty-step) as a Reaction in response to taking damage.

In addition, the following effects are now among your Steps of the Fey options.

**Disappearing Step.** You have the Invisible condition until the start of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.

**Dreadful Step.** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 Psychic damage.

### Level 10: Beguiling Defenses

Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the Charmed condition.

In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage you take. Once you use this Reaction, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

### Level 14: Bewitching Magic

Your patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and a spell slot, you can cast [Misty Step](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:misty-step) as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot.
