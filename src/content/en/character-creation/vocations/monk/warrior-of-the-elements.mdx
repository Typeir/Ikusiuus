# Warrior of the Elements

_The World Moves as You Move._

You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. By focusing your ki, you align with the forces of creation—bending earth, air, fire, and water to your will. Some monks dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave all four into one flowing practice.

Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers—coiling dragons, phoenixes, waves, or mountains that shift as they fight.
