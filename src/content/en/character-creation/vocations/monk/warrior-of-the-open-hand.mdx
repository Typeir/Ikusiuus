## 3rd Level – Open Hand Technique

When you hit a creature with an **attack granted by Flurry of Blows**, you may impose one of the following effects:

### Addle

The target **cannot make Opportunity Attacks** until the start of its next turn.

---

### Push

The target must succeed on a **Strength saving throw** or be **pushed up to 15 feet away** from you.

---

### Topple

The target must succeed on a **Dexterity saving throw** or fall **Prone**.

---

## 6th Level – Wholeness of Body

As a **Bonus Action**, you may roll your **Martial Arts die** and regain:

**Hit Points equal to the roll + Wisdom modifier** (minimum of 1 HP regained).

---

### Uses

Use this feature a number of times equal to your **Wisdom modifier** (minimum of once).  
You regain all expended uses when you finish a **Long Rest**.

---

## 11th Level – Fleet Step

When you take a **Bonus Action** other than **Step of the Wind**, you may immediately use **Step of the Wind** after it.

---

## 17th Level – Quivering Palm

When you hit a creature with an **Unarmed Strike**, you may expend **4 Focus Points** to set up lethal vibrations in the target’s body.

These vibrations:

- Last for a number of **days equal to your Monk level**.
- Are **harmless** unless you choose to end them.

---

### Ending the Vibrations

To end the vibrations:

- You and the target must be on the **same plane of existence**.
- Use an **Action**, or forgo one attack when you take the **Attack action**.

The target must make a **Constitution saving throw**.

- **Fail:** Takes **10d12 Force damage**.
- **Success:** Takes **half damage**.

---

### Limitations

- You may have only **one creature affected** by Quivering Palm at a time.
- You may **end the vibrations harmlessly** (no action required).
