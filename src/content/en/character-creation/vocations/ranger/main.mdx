# Ranger

Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger's talents and magic are honed with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

As a Ranger, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Ranger levels. These features are listed in the Ranger Features table.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See Chapter 7 for the rules on Spellcasting. The Information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in the [Ranger spell list](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/ranger:spell-list) later in the class's description.

**Spell Slots.** The Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells [Cure Wounds](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:cure-wounds) and [Ensnaring Strike](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:ensnaring-strike) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Ranger spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

### Level 1: Favored Enemy

You always have the [Hunter's Mark](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:hunter-s-mark) spell prepared.  
You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest.

The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger Levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of the Ranger Features table.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For Example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords.

### Level 2: Deft Explorer

Thanks to your travels, you gain the following benefits.

**Expertise.**: Choose one of your skill proficiencies with which you lack Expertise. You gain Expertise in that skill.

### Level 2: Fighting Style

**Druidic Warrior.** You learn two [Druid cantrips](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/druid:spell-list) of your choice (See the Druid class's section for a list of Druid spells). [Guidance](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:guidance) and [Starry Wisp](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:starry-wisp) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip.

### Level 3: Ranger Subclass

You gain a Ranger Subclass of your choice. The Beast Master, Fey Wanderer, Gloom Stalker and Hunter subclasses are detailed after this class's description. A Subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Ranger level or lower.
