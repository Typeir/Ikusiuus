## 3rd Level: Hunter's Lore

You can call upon the forces of nature to reveal certain strengths and weaknesses of your prey. While a creature is marked by your [Hunter's Mark](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:hunter-s-mark), you know whether the creature has any **Immunities**, **Resistances**, or **Vulnerabilities**, and if the creature has any, you know what they are.

You gain one of the following feature options of your choice. Whenever you finish a **Short or Long Rest**, you can replace the chosen option with the other one.

**Horde Breaker.**  
Once on each of your turns when you make an attack with a weapon, you can make **another attack with the same weapon** against a **different creature** that is within **5 feet** of the original target, that is within the weapon's range, and that you haven't attacked this turn.
