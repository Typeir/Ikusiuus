# Path of the Berserker

_Channel Rage into Violent Fury._

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them.

## 3rd Level – Frenzy

When you use **Reckless Attack** while your **Rage** is active, you deal extra damage to the **first target you hit** on your turn with a **Strength-based attack**.

- Roll a number of **d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus** and add them together.
- The extra damage has the **same type** as the weapon or Unarmed Strike used.

---

## 6th Level – Mindless Rage

While your **Rage** is active, you have **Immunity** to the **Charmed** and **Frightened** conditions.

- If you are Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage, the condition ends on you.

---

## 10th Level – Retaliation

When you take damage from a creature within **5 feet** of you, you can use your **Reaction** to make one **melee attack** against that creature, using a **weapon or Unarmed Strike**.

---

## 14th Level – Intimidating Presence

As a **Bonus Action**, you can strike terror into others with your menacing presence.

- Each creature of your choice in a **30-foot Aura** originating from you must make a **Wisdom saving throw** (DC = **8 + your Strength modifier + your Proficiency Bonus**).
- On a **failed save**, a creature gains the **Frightened condition** for **1 minute**.
- At the end of each of its turns, the creature may repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a **Long Rest**, unless you expend a use of your **Rage** (no action required) to restore its use.
