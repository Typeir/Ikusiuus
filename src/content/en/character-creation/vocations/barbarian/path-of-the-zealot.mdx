# Path of the Zealot

_Rage in Ecstatic Union with a God._

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Zealot receive boons from a god or pantheon. These Barbarians experience their Rage as an ecstatic episode of divine union that infuses them with power. They are often allies to priests and other followers of their deity.

On each of your turns while your **Rage** is active, the **first creature you hit** with a **weapon or Unarmed Strike** takes extra damage equal to:

**1d6 + half your Barbarian level (rounded down).**

You choose whether this damage is **Necrotic or Radiant** each time you deal it.

## 3rd Level – Warrior of the Gods

You gain a **pool of four d12s** that you can spend to heal yourself.

While in this form, you gain the following benefits:

### Flight

You gain a **Fly Speed equal to your Speed**, and you can **hover**.

### Resistance

You gain **Resistance to Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant damage**.

### Revivification
