Metamagic Options
-----------------

The following options are available to your Metamagic feature. The options are presented in alphabetical order.

### Careful Spell

Source: Player's Handbook  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Distant Spell

Source: Player's Handbook  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to make the spell’s range 30 feet.

### Empowered Spell

Source: Player's Handbook  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Extended Spell

Source: Player's Handbook  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

If the affected spell requires Concentration, you have Advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration.

Cost: 2 Sorcery Points

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell Disadvantage on saves against the spell.

### Quickened Spell

Source: Player's Handbook  
Cost: 2 Sorcery Points

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting.
