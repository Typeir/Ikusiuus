# Metamagic

## Metamagic Options

The following options are available to your Metamagic feature. The options are presented in alphabetical order.

### Careful Spell

**Cost:** 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. Choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Distant Spell

**Cost:** 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell’s range.  
When you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can instead spend 1 Sorcery Point to make the spell’s range 30 feet.

### Empowered Spell

**Cost:** 1 Sorcery Point

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

### Extended Spell

**Cost:** 1 Sorcery Point

### Quickened Spell

**Cost:** 2 Sorcery Points

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a **Bonus Action**.

You cannot modify a spell this way if you’ve already cast a level 1+ spell on this turn, nor can you cast another level 1+ spell after using this option.

### Seeking Spell

**Cost:** 1 Sorcery Point

If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20. You must use the new roll.

### Subtle Spell

**Cost:** 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it **without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components**, except for materials consumed by the spell or that have a cost.

### Transmuted Spell

When you cast a spell that deals damage of one of the following types, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to change that damage type to another from the list:  
**Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder.**

### Twinned Spell

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points **equal to the spell’s level** to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be **incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level**. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren’t eligible, but ray of frost is.
