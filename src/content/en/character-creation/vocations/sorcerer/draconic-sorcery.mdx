# Draconic Sorcery

_Breathe the Magic of Dragons_

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.

## Level 3: Draconic Resilience

The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift.

- Your **Hit Point maximum increases by 3**, and it increases by **1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level**.
- While you aren’t wearing armor, your **base Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier**.
