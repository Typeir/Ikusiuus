# Wild Magic Sorcery

_Unleash Chaotic Magic_

Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

## Level 3: Wild Magic Surge

Once per turn, when you cast a Sorcerer spell using a spell slot, roll 1d20. On a 20, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.

If the effect is a spell, it cannot be modified by your Metamagic.

## Level 3: Tides of Chaos

You can manipulate chaos to give yourself **Advantage** on one d20 Test before you roll. Once you do so, you must finish a Long Rest or cast a Sorcerer spell using a spell slot to use this feature again.

If you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot before finishing a Long Rest, you automatically roll on the Wild Magic Surge table.

## Level 6: Bend Luck

When another creature you can see makes a d20 Test, you can use your Reaction to spend 1 Sorcery Point and roll 1d4. Apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the target’s roll.

## Level 14: Controlled Chaos

Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either result.

## Level 18: Tamed Surge

Immediately after casting a Sorcerer spell using a spell slot, you can choose any effect from the Wild Magic Surge table (except the final row) instead of rolling. If the chosen effect requires a roll, you must make it.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
