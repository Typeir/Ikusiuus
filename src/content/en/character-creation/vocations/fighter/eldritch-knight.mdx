# Eldritch Knight

_Support Combat Skills with Arcane Magic._

Eldritch Knights combine the martial mastery common to all Fighters with a careful study of magic. Their spells both complement and extend their combat skills—providing additional protection, shoring up armor, and allowing them to engage multiple foes at once with explosive force.
