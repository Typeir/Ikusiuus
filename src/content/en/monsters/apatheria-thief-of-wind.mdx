## Traits

### Tombsteel Armor.

The Thief of Winds wears custom heavy armor forged from tombsteel, The armor has the following properties:

- Increases base AC by +1
- Increases the weight of the armor by +15 lbs
- Causes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks
- Grants advantage on saving throws made to resist being **pushed**, **pulled**, or **knocked prone**
- Grants the following features:
  **Grave Chill.**  
   Tombsteel armor holds up to **10 charges**. When a creature hits the Thief of Winds with a **melee weapon attack**, the attacker immediately takes **10 cold damage** as frozen rime shards erupt from the armor. This effect requires no action or reaction.

  - Each activation consumes **1 charge**
  - Charges **regenerate at midnight**, recovering **4 + 1d4 charges**
  - Cold damage ignores resistance from nonmagical armor or mundane sources

  **Cold Eternal.**  
  If a creature wearing Tombsteel Armor is **not resistant or immune to cold damage**, they must succeed on a **DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour** while wearing it. On a failed save, the creature gains **1 level of exhaustion**.
  This effect occurs even while sleeping or unconscious. The Thief of Winds is resistant to cold damage and thus ignores this effect.

  **Warding Bond (Integrated).**  
  The Thief of Winds’s armor contains an embedded permanent **Warding Bond** enchantment that links them to their mount. While both the Thief of Winds and their mount are alive and conscious:

  - The bonded creature **gains a +1 bonus to AC** (already included)
  - The bonded creature **gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws**
  - The bonded creature **gains resistance to all damage**
  - **All damage** that the bonded creature takes is **split equally** between them (each takes half)
  - The bond **ends immediately** if either creature drops to 0 HP or dies

- They **provoke opportunity attacks** even if they take the **Disengage** action
- If a creature within the aura is **hit by an opportunity attack** from the Thief of Winds or one of their allies, the target’s **movement speed is reduced by 10 feet** until the end of their next turn
- The aura is always active while the Thief of Winds is conscious

The Thief of Winds radiates a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot radius. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), she can use one of the following lair actions:

---

### Tombsteel Harpoon Rain

From distant siege vessels anchored around the island, Apatheria signals a synchronized bombardment. Massive tombsteel harpoons arc through the upper air and crash down like godslaying meteors.

- Apatheria designates **up to three 10-foot-radius impact zones** anywhere on the battlefield within 300 feet.
- Each creature in an impact zone must succeed on a **DC 16 Dexterity saving throw** or take **44 (8d10) piercing damage** and be **knocked prone**.

- A creature that succeeds takes half no damage and is not knocked prone.

- The ground in each affected zone becomes **difficult terrain** until cleared. The embedded harpoons remain as **half-cover**, impassable unless destroyed or climbed.

> These harpoons are made of **tombsteel**. Their presence suppresses ongoing magical effects within 5 feet of impact (no concentration spells, magical healing, or teleportation functions in the zone).

---

### Skyfall

The air cracks like glass. A silent rupture spreads across the battlefield—then explodes.

- All creatures outside Apatheria’s **Warding Wind aura** are subject to a **300-foot-radius Shatter** centered on the battlefield.
- Each must make a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw**.

  - **Fail:** 6d8 thunder damage
  - **Success:** Half damage

> Creatures **within Apatheria’s Warding Wind aura** are **deafened** and **immune to this damage**.

---

### **Reinforcements**

Apatheria signals to allied forces positioned throughout the shattered island perimeter. In response, a squad of contracted militiamen breaches the field.

- **1d4 Mercenary Militiamen** appear at strategic locations of Apatheria’s choosing (within 60 feet of her, unoccupied space).
- They act on initiative count 10 and are hostile to Apatheria’s enemies.
- Each militiaman is equipped with standard glaives, javelins, and ironclad light armor. They are trained but expendable.

> The mercenaries fight tactically, positioning to intercept threats to Apatheria, and will not willingly enter her Warding Wind unless ordered.

---

---

## Battlefield Actions

### Resonant Shatter

**Declare (on hit):** Each time Apatheria hits with a melee weapon attack, she pulls the skies down, creating a resonant storm marker at the target’s location.

**Resolve (start of her next turn):** the skies drop at each marked location, casting the [_Shatter_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shatter) spell.  
Creatures within **10 feet** of each marked location must make a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw**.

- **Fail:** 3d8 thunder damage.
- **Success:** Half damage.

> Creatures **inside Apatheria’s Warding Wind aura** are **immune to these effects** due to the deafening roar.  
> This action does not require an action or recharge; it resolves automatically as a battlefield effect.

## Phase Actions

### Bloodied (50% HP):

Apatheria casts [_Warding Wind_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:warding-wind) on herself without expending a spell slot or requiring concentration, and it's range increases to 25 ft.  
 The roaring wind centers on her body and moves with her for the rest of the battle. The effect cannot be dispelled by magical means lower than **6th level**.

Apatheria's range increases by 15 feet, as bursts of cutting wind echo from her blade.

She also unlocks the stolen power of Ukonhemmo’s storm and wind vakis. For the remainder of the encounter, she gains the following spells as **prepared**:

- **Cantrips:** [_Gust_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gust), [_Thunderclap_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:thunderclap), [_Shocking Grasp_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shocking-grasp)

- **2nd-level:** [_Warding Wind_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:warding-wind), [_Gust of Wind_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gust-of-wind), [_Shatter_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shatter)
- **3rd-level:** [_Call Lightning_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:call-lightning), [_Wind Wall_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wind-wall), [_Lightning Arrow_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:lightning-arrow)

- **5th-level:** [_Control Winds_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:control-winds), [_Destructive Wave_](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:destructive-wave)
  These spells are cast using her normal spellcasting stats (DC 16, +8 to hit).  
  All of them require **no spell slots**, do **not require material components**, but each can only be cast **once per short rest**.

### Doomed (25% HP):

Apatheria tears open the veil between the upper sky and the battlefield, calling down several pillars of lightning.  
 All creatures of her choice within **30 feet** must succeed on a **DC 16 Dexterity saving throw** or take **4d12 lightning damage** and be **blinded** until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not blinded.  
 This effect ignores resistance to lightning damage. Apatheria and her mount immediately gain **flying speed equal to their walking speed** (hover) for 1 minute.
If Ukkonhemmo has not been freed when Apatheria reaches this threshold, she immediately kills him with the lightning bolt.
