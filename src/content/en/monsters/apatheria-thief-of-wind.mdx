### Traits

#### Tombsteel Armor.

The Thief of Winds wears custom heavy armor forged from tombsteel, The armor has the following properties:

- Increases base AC by +1
- Increases the weight of the armor by +15 lbs
- Causes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks
- Grants advantage on saving throws made to resist being **pushed**, **pulled**, or **knocked prone**
- Grants the following features:
  **Grave Chill.**  
   Tombsteel armor holds up to **10 charges**. When a creature hits the Thief of Winds with a **melee weapon attack**, the attacker immediately takes **10 cold damage** as frozen rime shards erupt from the armor. This effect requires no action or reaction.

  - Each activation consumes **1 charge**
  - Charges **regenerate at midnight**, recovering **4 + 1d4 charges**
  - Cold damage ignores resistance from nonmagical armor or mundane sources

  **Cold Eternal.**  
  If a creature wearing Tombsteel Armor is **not resistant or immune to cold damage**, they must succeed on a **DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour** while wearing it. On a failed save, the creature gains **1 level of exhaustion**.
  This effect occurs even while sleeping or unconscious. The Thief of Winds is resistant to cold damage and thus ignores this effect.

  **Warding Bond (Integrated).**  
  The Thief of Winds’s armor contains an embedded permanent **Warding Bond** enchantment that links them to their mount. While both the Thief of Winds and their mount are alive and conscious:

  - The bonded creature **gains a +1 bonus to AC** (already included)
  - The bonded creature **gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws**
  - The bonded creature **gains resistance to all damage**
  - **All damage** that the bonded creature takes is **split equally** between them (each takes half)
  - The bond **ends immediately** if either creature drops to 0 HP or dies
