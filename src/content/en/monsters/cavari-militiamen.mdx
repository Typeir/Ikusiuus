## Traits

**Curved-Blade Discipline.**  
The militiaman treats curved weapons (shotel, khopesh, hooked halberd) or falchions, bows and daggers as **finesse weapons** and may reroll 1s on their damage dice once per turn with them.

**Shield Catch.**  
When the militiaman hits a creature wielding a shield with a curved weapon, they may **immediately attempt to shove or disarm** the target as a **bonus action**. The contest is **Athletics vs. Athletics**, and the target has **disadvantage** if the attempt targets their shield.

**Equipment.**

The militiaman is armed and armoured as follows:
