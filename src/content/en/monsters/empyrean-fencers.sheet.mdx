- **Legendary Resistance (2/Day)**: If the Fencer fails a saving throw, they can choose to succeed instead.

- **Regeneration**: The Fencer regains 10 hit points at the start of their turn unless they are in contact with radiant energy.

- **Thunderous Hurl** (Recharge 5–6): The Fencer throws a greatsword in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 slashing damage and 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. The sword then explodes with thunderous force, dealing 4d6 thunder damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the target.

  - A storm cloud appears 100 feet above, centered on a point the Fencer can see within 120 feet. A bolt of lightning strikes down at a point the Fencer chooses. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half on a success.

- **Hurl to Partner** (Costs 2 Actions): The Fencer hurls a greatsword toward their partner, the **Fencer of the Épée**. The Fencer of the Épée may use their reaction to automatically deflect the greatsword and send it flying toward a target within 30 feet, forcing the target to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 slashing damage and 2d6 thunder damage. The sword breaks after this deflection.
