# Lunar Kystepod

<BlendedImage src='/library/images/Kystepod.webp' alt='Kystepod' />

**Lunar Kystepods** are bloated, many-limbed insectoid monstrosities resembling a grotesque blend between a cockroach and a deep-buried tick with uncannily humanoid features. Created through parasitic grafting and blood rituals, they serve the **Cerithol Lunam** as guardians, scouts, and blood gatherers. Though they lack higher intelligence, their instincts are perfectly tuned to the will of the Cerithol. Their shells pulse with a thick antimagic mucus, and their joints leak slow trails of acidic lymph that burn wherever they step. In groups, their speed and cruelty are overwhelming.

_Medium Monstrosity, Unaligned_

## Traits

- **Loyal Symbiote.**  
  The Lunar Kystepod is biologically tethered to Cerithol Lunami. While within 300 ft. of a Cerithol, it gains **pack tactics** and **cannot be frightened**. Additionally, the Cerithol can communicate telepathically with it.

- **Lunar Chitin.**  
  The Kystepod's outer shell reflects spell energy in strange ways. When the Kystepod is targeted by a damaging spell that requires a saving throw, roll a d6. On a **6**, the spell rebounds at the original caster using the same attack or save DC.

- **Five-Legged Skitter.**  
  The Kystepod can move across ceilings, walls, and rough surfaces without needing to make checks. Its movement ignores difficult terrain caused by organic or fleshy terrain.

## Actions

- **Multiattack.**  
  The Lunar Kystepod makes two attacks: either with _Chitin Claws_, with _Acidic Ventral Harpoon_, it's _Tendrils_ or it's _Held Weapons_.

- **Chitin Claws.**  
  _Melee Weapon Attack_: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
  **Hit**: 12 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed a **DC 13 Strength saving throw** or be knocked prone.

- **Acidic Ventral Harpoon.**  
  _Melee Weapon Attack_: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
  **Hit**: 14 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the target is already prone, it suffers **maximum acid damage**.

- **Tendril**
  _Melee Weapon Attack_: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
  **Hit**: 16 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

## Reactions

- **Spasm of Obedience.**  
  _When a Cerithol Lunam within 300 ft. takes damage_:  
  The Kystepod may move up to its full movement toward the Cerithol and immediately use _Chitin Claws_ if a target is within range.
