## Traits

- **Choking Dust**:  
  Anytime the Tombsteel Construct takes bludgeoning or slashing damage, a cloud of choking mold and dust explodes 10 feet in all directions. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, or become poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way and not cured within 24 hours must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or contract the disease, Slimy Doom. A creature with Slimy Doom bleeds uncontrollably, resulting in disadvantage on Constitution checks and saving throws. Additionally, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

- **Immutable Form**:  
  The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

- **Maddening Remains**:  
  When a Tombsteel Construct is killed, anyone examining the strips of scroll parchment and tome pages comprising much of the creature’s body must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed with insanity. The victim becomes convinced that the parchment contains a lost arcane secret that can only be revealed by reassembling the pieces. The victim becomes obsessed and dedicates every waking hour to this task, suffering 1d8 psychic damage upon activation of the curse and 1d8 psychic damage weekly thereafter. This damage reduces the victim's hit point maximum, and it cannot be prevented in any way.

- **Magic Resistance**:  
  The Tombsteel Construct has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

- **Magic Weapons**:  
  The Tombsteel Construct’s weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions

- **Multiattack**:  
  The Tombsteel Construct makes two slam attacks.

- **Slam**:  
  _Melee Weapon Attack_: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.  
  _Hit_: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Innate Spellcasting**:  
A Tombsteel Construct is created with the ability to innately cast spells once each per day. The Tombsteel Construct’s innate spellcasting ability is Constitution (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components for these spells. A typical Tombsteel Construct can cast the following spells:

- **1/day each**:  
  _Chain Lightning, Cone of Cold, Dimension Door, Fireball, Hold Person, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Raise Dead, Shield, Vampiric Touch_
