## Traits

**Martial Focus.** Redeemed Ludwig does not rely on offensive spells. His blood magic enhances only his own speed, strength, and durability. All of his attacks are considered magical.

**Bloodflare Surge (3/Long Rest).** As a bonus action, Ludwig may burn his own blood to ignite his strength. For 1 minute:

- Gains **+2 AC**
- Deals **+2d6 radiant damage** with all melee attacks
- Gains **advantage** on all Strength-based checks and saves
- Regains **20 HP** at the start of each turn

**Unbreakable Form.** Ludwig has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from magical and nonmagical weapons. He is immune to exhaustion and forced movement.

**Legendary Resistances (3/Long Rest).** If Ludwig fails a saving throw, he may choose to succeed instead.

_Redeemed Ludwig is not the god who brings peace. He is the warrior who holds back the tide until peace is possible._
