## Actions

- **Multiattack**: The Landshark makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3d10 + 6 piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the Landshark can't bite another target.

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d8 + 6 Bludgeoning damage.

**Burrow and Ambush**: The Landshark can burrow underground as a bonus action, moving up to 30 feet. If it ends this movement within 5 feet of a creature, it can make a bite attack against that creature as part of the same action.

**Legendary Resistance (1/Day)**: If the Landshark fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
