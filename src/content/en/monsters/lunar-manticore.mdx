A **Lunar Manticore** is a quadrupedal predator from the surface of Kuutar. It wields four venomous claws and three twitching insect-like tails, each capable of striking with surgical precision. Originally bred by the first Pieni settlers of the silvery peaks,
these creatures were gifted as a peace offering to the Empyreans, and some are unnaturally loyal to God-Challengers and often paired with tombsteel riders.

## Traits

**Warding Bond (Integrated).**  
The manticore is bound to its rider via inbuilt warding glyphs etched into its collar and chest-plate:

- It gains **+1 bonus to AC** (included), and **+1 to all saving throws**
- While both rider and mount are alive, **they each take half damage from all sources**
- The bond ends when either drops to 0 hit points

**Venom-Conductive Body.**  
All natural melee attacks made by the Lunar Manticore are treated as **magical weapons**. Targets damaged by the manticore’s melee attacks have their **speed reduced by 10 feet** until the start of their next turn.

## Actions

**Multiattack.**  
The manticore makes one swinging attack with its claws, one bitting attack with its jaws, and up to **three Tail Spike** attacks, provided each targets a different creature.
The manticore can replce its three tail attacks with one **Venom Pulse**.

**Bite.**
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 11 (1d12 + 4) piercing damage + 7 (1d6 + 3) poison damage.
**Claw.**
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 9 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage + 7 (1d6 + 3) poison damage.

**Tail Spike.**  
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target  
_Hit:_ 10 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage + 7 (1d6 + 3) poison damage.  
If the target is hit, their movement speed is reduced by 10 ft. until the start of the manticore’s next turn.

**Venom Pulse (Recharge 5–6).**  
The manticore channels stored glandular poison into a violent surge.  
All creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from the manticore must make a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw**:

- On a **failure**, they take **21 (6d6) poison damage** and are **poisoned** for an hour.
- On a **success**, they take half damage and are not poisoned.
  This ability **recharges on a roll of 5–6 at the start of each turn**
