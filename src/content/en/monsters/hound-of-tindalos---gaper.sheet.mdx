# Hound of Tindalos – Gaper

Where ordinary Hounds of Tindalos devour space, **Gapers rewrite it**. Their enormous, yawning torsos contain not flesh but prophecy — divine code etched into unknowable space. They are the whispering agents of the Canvas, and the only prayer they offer is annihilation.

## Traits

- **Gaping Maw of Revelation**  
  Creatures that start their turn within 5 ft. must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become **Charmed** until the end of their next turn. If already Charmed, they are instead **Paralyzed** for 1 round.

- **Celestial Logic**  
  When a creature fails a saving throw against one of the Gaper’s spells, it cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn.

- **Hovering Stillness**  
  If the Gaper does not move on its turn, it gains **+2 AC** and is immune to being Grappled or Restrained until the start of its next turn.

## Actions

- **Twin Mantra (At-Will)**  
  The Gaper casts two cantrips per round: one _Toll the Dead_ (DC 13 Wis save) and one _Sacred Flame_ (DC 13 Dex save), targeting different creatures within 60 ft.

- **Fold Static (Recharge 5–6)**  
  Unleashes fold energy in a 15 ft. cone. Each creature must make a DC 13 Constitution save or take 3d8 thunder damage and fall prone. Half on success.
