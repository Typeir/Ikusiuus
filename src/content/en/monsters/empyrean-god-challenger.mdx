### Traits

#### Tombsteel Armor.

The God-Challenger wears custom heavy armor forged from tombsteel, The armor has the following properties:

- Increases base AC by +1
- Increases the weight of the armor by +15 lbs
- Causes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks
- Grants advantage on saving throws made to resist being **pushed**, **pulled**, or **knocked prone**
- Grants the following features:
  **Grave Chill.**  
   Tombsteel armor holds up to **10 charges** of reactive cold stored in its rime-slicked seams. When a creature hits the God-Challenger with a **melee weapon attack**, the attacker immediately takes **10 cold damage** as frozen tendrils erupt from the armor. This effect requires no action or reaction.

  - Each activation consumes **1 charge**
  - Charges **regenerate at midnight**, recovering **4 + 1d4 charges**
  - Cold damage ignores resistance from nonmagical armor or mundane sources

  **Cold Eternal.**  
  If a creature wearing Tombsteel Armor is **not resistant or immune to cold damage**, they must succeed on a **DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour** while wearing it. On a failed save, the creature gains **1 level of exhaustion**.
  This effect occurs even while sleeping or unconscious. The God-Challenger is resistant to cold damage and thus ignores this effect.

  **Warding Bond (Integrated).**  
  The God-Challenger’s armor contains an embedded permanent **Warding Bond** enchantment that links them to their mount. While both the God-Challenger and their mount are alive and conscious:

  - Both creatures **gain a +1 bonus to AC** (already included)
  - Both creatures **gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws**
  - **All damage** that either creature takes is **split equally** between them (each takes half)
  - The bond **ends immediately** if either creature drops to 0 HP or dies

**Target of the Hunt.**  
The God-Challenger has sworn to hunt specific prey. The God-Challenger's chosen prey are Aberrations and Monstrosities.
The God-Challenger gains the following benefits against the chosen prey:

- Gains **advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks** to track them
- Gains **advantage on Intelligence checks** to recall lore or information about them
- Gains **double proficiency bonus** on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against them
- Speaks **one additional language** used by the selected prey type (Hidden, in this case)

**Aura of Interception (10-foot radius).**  
The God-Challenger emits an aura that suppresses flight and escape. While creatures are within 10 feet of the God-Challenger:

- They **provoke opportunity attacks** even if they take the **Disengage** action
- If a creature within the aura is **hit by an opportunity attack** from the God-Challenger or one of their allies, the target’s **movement speed is reduced by 10 feet** until the end of their next turn
- The aura is always active while the God-Challenger is conscious

**Mounted Brutality.**  
While mounted, the God-Challenger’s melee weapon attacks deal **an additional 1d6 damage** of the weapon’s type.
