## Traits

- **Angelical Link**: Xanthous can summon angels with which he shares a health pool. Anytime an angel takes damage, xanthous takes an equal ammount of indirect damage.

- **Unbreakable Mind**: If Xanthous isn't dealt at least 100 direct damage in a round, he regenerates all the damage he took, including angelical link damage.

- **Weakened form**: Xanthous is weakened in his current state, and cannot cast spells of 6th, 7th, 8th, or 9th level. Additionally, his multiattack strikes thrice instead of five times, additionally, he suffers a -5 penalty to all saving throws, attack rolls and skill checks. And he loses 5 AC, This effect lasts until the next day. Additionally, Xanthous spawns without any angels.

- **Scourge of the mind**: Xanthous immediately knows when one is withholding informatiton, as it understands when something has not reached the cusp of it's being, even words, phrases, or truths, even if he does not know the truth itself.
  Additionally, Xanthous always knows each creature's vulneravilities or least developed areas.

- **Aura of Devotion**: Any creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of Xanthous must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the _Charm Person_ spell until the end of its next turn. A creature can only be affected by this once every minute.

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**: If Xanthous fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Poison of the mind

Xanthous's very pressence causes adverse effects. If a creature interacts with Xanthous in any way, such as speaking, touching, or being struck by him in any way, they must succeed on a DC13 Wisdom saving throw, or be affected by one of the following curse - illnesses. Characters immune to sickness and curses ignore this feature, and take 1d6 psychic damage instead.
