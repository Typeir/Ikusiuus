## Traits

- **Puppet Master**: The Duke can use his action to manipulate a creature within 60 feet that he can see, forcing it to make a **Wisdom saving throw (DC 19)**. On a failed save, the creature must use its reaction to move up to half its speed and make one melee attack against a target of the Duke’s choice.

- **Regeneration**: The Duke regains 15 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of his next turn.

- **Master Manipulator**: The Duke has advantage on all Charisma checks and saving throws.

- **Commanding Presence** (Recharge 5–6): The Duke can force all creatures of his choice within 30 feet to make a **Wisdom saving throw (DC 19)**.
