A **Child of Ukkonhemmo** is a massive, kite-winged wasp-like being—one of the divine offspring of the storm god. Though their forms are monstrous, they act with serene intention. They strike only when the sacred balance is broken.

## Traits

**Children of the winds.**  
The Child does not breathe and is unaffected by high winds or fall distance, as if affected by the [_Feather Fall_](https://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:feather-fall) spell.

**Protective Instinct.**  
When a creature within 10 feet of the Child is reduced to 0 HP, the Child may use its reaction to fly up to 30 feet and interpose itself between the creature and its attacker. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

---

## Actions

**Multiattack.**  
The Child makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.**  
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 32 (5d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Divebomb.**  
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

- _Hit:_ **41 (6d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage** and the target is **knocked prone**
- If the target is already prone or flying, it instead takes **maximum damage (67)** and it's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn, as it reels in pain

This attack can only be performed after falling at least 30 feet downwards.

**Backwing Pulse (Recharge 5–6).**  
The Child releases a shockwave of wind from its wings.  
All creatures in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a **DC 17 Strength saving throw** or be **pushed 20 feet**, **blinded** and **knocked prone**.
