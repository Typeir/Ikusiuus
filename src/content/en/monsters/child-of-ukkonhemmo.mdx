A **Child of Ukkonhemmo** is a massive, kite-winged wasp-like being—one of the divine offspring of the storm god. Though their forms are monstrous, they act with serene intention. They strike only when the sacred balance is broken.

## Traits

**Children of the Winds.**  
The Child does not breathe and is unaffected by high winds or fall distance, as if under constant _Feather Fall_.

**Protective Instinct.**  
When a creature within 10 feet is reduced to 0 HP, the Child may use its reaction to fly up to 30 feet and interpose itself between that creature and its attacker. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

**Elemental Resilience.**  
At creation, each Child selects one of the following: **fire, cold, acid, thunder, or lightning**.  
The child **ignores resistance** to thunder damage.

**Unnerving Mind.**  
The Child has **advantage on saving throws** against being affected by **mind-altering magic**.

**Innate Spellcasting.**  
It can innately cast the following spells without components or slots, each of them once per short rest:
