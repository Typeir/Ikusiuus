# Cerithol Lunam

<BlendedImage src='/library/images/Cerithol.webp' alt='Cerithol' />

A **Cerithol Lunam** is a grotesque, fleshy orb that dwells deep within the corpse-womb of the half-slain moon goddess. Half-Blind and bulbous, it moves on four bloated intestine-like ungulate hooves and is covered in translucent, sticky mucus. When threatened, it splits open to reveal a writhing core of veins, flesh and razor-sharp bones that lashes out across impossible distance. It casts spells from holes that open briefly to hiss, bleed, or scream, uses malformed apendages to communicate in windings, and its acidic blood burns like starfire.
