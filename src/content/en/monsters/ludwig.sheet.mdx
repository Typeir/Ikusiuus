## Traits

**Bloodboil Aura.** Constant. Creatures that start their turn within 15 ft. take **1d6 fire damage**, unavoidable. This ignores resistance and immunity.

**Regeneration.** Ludwig regains **20 HP** at the start of each of his turns. While in Bloodrage, he instead regains **30 HP**.

**Severing Blood (Recharge 5–6).** One creature within 60 ft. is **Paralyzed** and takes **1d10 fire damage** at the start of each of its turns. This burning cannot be extinguished by nonmagical means. At the end of each turn, the creature may attempt a **DC 22 Constitution saving throw** to end the effect.

**Legendary Resistances (3/Long Rest).** If Ludwig fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

---

## Bloodrage (1/Short Rest)

As a **bonus action**, Ludwig enters a divine fury for **5 rounds** (30 seconds). While active:

- Gains **50 temporary HP** immediately.
- Gains **advantage on the first attack** he makes each round.
- Can make **one extra attack** as part of his Multiattack.
- All his attacks deal an extra **2d6 fire damage**.
- Gains **15 temporary HP** at the start of each turn.

**If Ludwig neither deals nor takes damage for a full round, Bloodrage ends early.**

---

- **Cantrips (at will):** Thaumaturgy, Toll the Dead, Minor Illusion
- **1st level (4/long rest):** _Bloodlash Rebuke_, Shield, Absorb Elements
- **2nd level (3/long rest):** Hold Person, Misty Step

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Ludwig makes **three attacks**, which can be _Mooncleaver_, _Gore Hurl_, _Bloodspire Growth_, or a cantrip. While in Bloodrage, he makes **four**.

**Mooncleaver.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target  
_Hit:_ 2d10 + 10 slashing + 2d6 cold damage, plus **2d6 fire** if Bloodrage is active.

**Gore Hurl.** Ludwig throws a **grappled creature** up to 60 ft. The creature lands in a **20-ft. radius** area. All creatures there must make a **DC 19 Dexterity saving throw** or take **6d6 bludgeoning damage** and fall prone. The thrown creature automatically takes the damage and is no longer grappled.

**Bloodspire Growth (Recharge 5–6).** Ludwig charges up to 30 ft. in a straight line. A massive spire of divine blood erupts beneath a target, who must make a **DC 19 Strength saving throw** or take **10d10 piercing damage**, be **Restrained**, and launched atop a **60-ft. tall spire**. Creatures in a **20-ft. wide** trail take **4d6 fire damage** and are **pushed 5 feet** without a save. The path remains aflame until the start of Ludwig’s next turn.

---

## Battlefield Action: Grand Mooncleave (Recharge 6)

**Declare (Turn 1):** Ludwig channels apocalyptic power into Mooncleaver.  
**Resolve (Turn 2):** Creatures in a **600-ft.-long**, **40-ft.-wide**, **80-ft.-tall** line must make a **DC 20 Dexterity saving throw**.

- **Fail:** 12d10 + 50 force damage and are knocked prone.
- **Success:** Half damage.

---

## Legendary Actions (3/round)

- **Attack.** Ludwig makes one _Mooncleaver_ attack.
- **Dragstep.** Ludwig moves up to 20 ft. and attempts to **grapple each creature** he moves through. Grappled creatures are **Restrained by blood chains**, but his hands remain free.
- **Spire of Blood (Costs 2).** A blood spire erupts beneath a creature within 30 ft. The target must make a **DC 19 Dexterity saving throw** or take **8d10 piercing damage** and be launched 20 ft. into the air (landing prone unless it succeeds a DC 15 Acrobatics check).
- **Cast a Spell (Costs 2).** Ludwig casts one spell of 2nd level or lower.

_Blood Memory Ludwig is not a god, nor a servant of one—he is what remains when divinity flees and something still refuses to die._
