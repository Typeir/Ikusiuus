## 📖 **Session Recap**

The party **infiltrated the Grimalkin Manse**, managing to **trick the guards** and sneak inside using **one of Lystig’s magical talking stones**. **They moved carefully**, but **a handmaid nearly spotted them**. Sigus and Ukko **convinced her** they were merely **hired scribes**, **avoiding suspicion**.

Inside, they encountered **Grimalkin Junior**, the son of Amon Grimalkin. Unlike his father, he **was not particularly interested in stopping them**. In fact, he **encouraged them to steal the book**, hoping it might **release his father from his all-consuming obsession**. He **led them to Amon’s private study**, revealing the **gilded chest hidden behind a bookcase**.

However, the **chest was trapped**. Upon attempting to open it, a **Phase Construct was summoned**—a being of **pure energy, alchemical precursor flowing through its form like liquid light**. It **moved unpredictably, almost like a dancer**, striking with **supernatural precision**.

During the fight, **the creature’s attacks ignited parts of the manse**, causing **an uncontrolled fire** to break out. Mid-battle, the **floor gave way**, sending **both the party and the Construct tumbling downward**. The battle **continued in the ruined chamber**, where the Construct’s **form flickered unstably** as it neared its end.

Upon its **defeat**, the Construct **exploded in a burst of alchemical energy**, **dousing the party in unrefined alchemical precursor**. The **manse continued to burn**, forcing the party to **escape into the underground well**.

The party **took a short rest (8 hours, gritty realism rules) in the well’s depths**, their **bodies still coated in unstable precursor**, while the **golden book’s secrets remained locked behind a foreign language**.
