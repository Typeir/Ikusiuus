## 📖 **Session Recap**

Sigus **agreed to undergo an experiment** to test his **connection to his celestial patron**. As part of this, **Camille and Father** restrained him in front of the **Primordial Wax Gate** to sever his **bond to his pact weapon**. When Sigus **attempted to recall the weapon**, an **enormous translucent blue blade slammed into the door**, followed by a **veiny, eleven-fingered hand** whispering:

> **"Not yet, not now... you are not ready."**

After the experiment, the party **experienced strange distortions** throughout the **castle**, with hallways stretching unnaturally, time behaving inconsistently, and **visions of vast landscapes haunting them in their dreams**.

They **snuck into the Wax Gate**, finding an **observatory filled with celestial tapestries and a sculpture of a massive red tree** (_The Tree of Fate_). There, they encountered a **guardian**, who claimed they **lived in a mere copy of a copy of the world**. The creature transported them to one of **seven primordial towers**, where it **challenged them to battle**.

After a **grueling fight**, **Lystig delivered the final blow**, but **Sigus succumbed to compulsion**, taking the **Blade of Creation** and **devouring the fallen entity**. The party **returned to their world**.
