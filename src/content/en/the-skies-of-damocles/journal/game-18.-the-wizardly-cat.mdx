## 📖 **Session Recap**

The party ventured deeper into the **Tripodan outskirts**, encountering an **abandoned mill village**. There, they spotted **two figures in conversation**, but Niccolo sensed something was **off**. The "people" were actually an **illusion**, conjured by a **wizardly Suncat named Kipinoita**, who **ambushed Niccolo**. Overwhelmed, the Suncat **fled**.

Further exploration led Niccolo to a **chest atop the ruined mill**, which he suspected to be **trapped**. Lystig confirmed it, and together they **safely triggered the trap** using Mage Hand—collapsing the **entire building** but recovering **five arcane scrolls**.

Avoiding **thumper nests** along the route, the party **reached the village at the base of Verbrune**, where they **unexpectedly found Ludriq**, who had snuck away to **paint Tripodan wildlife**. He **hired the party for 2,000 daggers** to **distract the wizardly Suncat** while he sketched it.

The party **found and paralyzed Kipinoita** with **Lystig's paralysis arrows**, but were soon **ambushed by other Suncats**. In a shocking turn, **Kipinoita betrayed his own kind**, revealing himself to be an **agent of the Society of Occult Knowledge**—alongside another wizard, **Loitsunmetsästäjä (Loitsunme)**, a **four-armed, crystal-mace-wielding lizardlike sorcerer**.

Loitsunme, displeased with the commotion caused by the party, **challenged them to a game**—they must **race Kipinoita in an alchemical-precursor-powered vehicle competition**. If they **win**, they **gain access to the mountain** without issue. If they **lose**, they **owe him a favor**.
