On their way there, **Sigus was attacked by a pit octopus** but managed to **kill it before it could cause serious harm**.

At **The Seven Rats Inn**, they met **Jaeger**, but before they could finalize their deal, **two Brumean assassins ambushed them**. The innkeepers **attempted to set a trap** for the assassins, handing the party a **jar containing a toxic crab**, but the assassins saw through the trick and **flipped the table over**, starting a **brutal fight**.

The **assassins mutated into grotesque abominations** after **one round of combat**, revealing their unnatural nature. **Despite their monstrous forms, the party managed to put them down**.

However, as they prepared to enter, **a massive pit octopus and two smaller ones ambushed them**. **Sigus was grabbed and nearly drowned**, but the party managed to **kill the creatures and press forward toward the estate**.
