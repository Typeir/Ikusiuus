# Fold Interference

**Whenever a character casts a spell within the alchemical precursor-saturated mines of Horngrove**, they must succeed on a **Charisma saving throw** or trigger a fold anomaly that distorts the spell.

- **Initial DC:** 10
- **Each failure increases the DC by +5.**
- **The DC resets only if the caster leaves the mines for at least 1 hour.**

If the save is **failed**, roll a **d100** on the following table to determine the resulting magical distortion.

### d100 – Alchemical Precursor Distortion Table

| d100  | Effect                                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Spell fizzles harmlessly into crackling static. Spell slot is consumed.                                                                           |
| 2–5   | The spell’s damage type becomes **force**. If it had no damage, it gains 1d8 force damage.                                                        |
| 6–10  | The spell’s damage becomes **radiant** and sheds bright light in a 10ft radius.                                                                   |
| 11–13 | Spellcaster is launched **40ft** in a straight line toward the spell's target. If they collide, both take 1d6 bludgeoning.                        |
| 14–16 | The spell is replaced with a **Sunbeam** spell centered on the original target (DC equals original spell DC).                                     |
| 17–20 | A spatial fracture forms briefly at the caster's position, conjuring a **sleet storm** for 1d4 rounds.                                            |
| 21–23 | All creatures within 5ft of the target must succeed a **Dexterity save** or be **blinded** until the end of their next turn.                      |
| 24–27 | The spell manifests as an echo. It **recasts itself** at the start of the caster’s next turn without cost.                                        |
| 28–32 | Caster **misty steps away** on a straight line from the target. If the target is self, caster **misty steps straight up**.                        |
| 33–36 | Spell creates an unstable field. A creature in the area gains **disadvantage on concentration checks** for 1 minute.                              |
| 37–41 | Caster’s body flickers out of phase. Gains **resistance to all damage** until the start of their next turn.                                       |
| 42–46 | **Sacred flame** is cast on every creature within 60ft, as if cast by a 5th level spellcaster.                                                    |
| 47–51 | The targets of the spell have disadvantage on **Wisdom checks and saving throws**, as their minds are addled by energy.                           |
| 52–55 | A static pulse surges from the spell’s impact point. All creatures within 10ft must make a **Constitution save** or be **deafened** for 1 minute. |
| 56–60 | After the spell affects the target, the caster swaps positions with one of the affected creatures, chosen by the caster.                          |
| 61–65 | The spell opens a **brief window into the folds**, causing the caster to take **1d4 psychic damage** and become **stunned until end of turn**.    |
| 66–70 | The target is momentarily pinned by invisible force. Their **speed is reduced to 0 until the end of their next turn**.                            |
| 71–74 | Spell’s energy tears nearby gravity. Creatures within 10ft of the target are **pulled 5ft** toward it.                                            |
| 75–78 | All metallic weapons and armor within 30ft of the caster are affected by **Heat Metal**, dealing radiant damage instead of fire.                  |
| 79–82 | Caster gains brief insight. They can **reroll one saving throw** before the end of their next turn.                                               |
| 83–86 | The spell becomes **delayed**: it activates at the start of the caster’s next turn instead of now.                                                |
| 87–90 | The caster becomes **invisible** until they cast another spell or take damage.                                                                    |
| 91–94 | A **rift briefly opens**, pulling in dust and air. All ranged weapon attacks suffer **disadvantage** for 1 round.                                 |
| 95–97 | Spell absorbs ambient fold energy. **Double its area of effect**, if applicable.                                                                  |
| 98–99 | The caster is affected by fold energy leaks. Every spell they cast until their next short rest is affected by this table, **without a save**.     |
| 100   | The spell is **upcast by 1d6 levels** (maximum level 9).                                                                                          |
