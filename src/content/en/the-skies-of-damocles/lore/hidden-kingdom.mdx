# **Hidden Kingdom:**

---

## _Common_

The **Hidden Kingdom**, believed to be a fairytale land by most, and a sort of collective hallucination from Dwarves, Gnomes, and Hobbits, is supposedly a lustrous land full of grand canyons and impressive vistas, where technology is of utmost importance and everyone lives a relatively peaceful existence. The inhabitants of the **Hidden Kingdom** often paint a grimmer picture of it, insisting that some sort of war ravaged the land sometime in the past, and they're still recovering.

Fairytale creatures such as Gnolls, Goblins, Orcs, and all sorts of man-eating monstrosities used to scare kids are believed to hail from the **Hidden Kingdom**.

## _Advanced_

The **Hidden Kingdom** is in fact a real place, not a collective hallucination. There is no known way to get there. Most of the people who claim to have gone in and out of the **Hidden Kingdom** experience amnesia and forget the means they used to go there, but most of what they did in there remains intact. The society in the **Hidden Kingdom** used to be scholastic and patriarchal, with some cults and vague adherences to gods and oaths. Nowadays, ravaged by the **Interlocking**, the **Hidden Kingdom** is lawless and mostly dominated by the **Blood Gnomes** and their death cult. Specks of civilization exist here and there, although racial tensions are sparking constant conflict.

Dwarves and Hobbits lay blame for the **Interlocking** on **Blood Gnomes**, while **Blood Gnomes** believe science and hubris to be the cause. Some **Gnomes**, or as the inhabitants of the **Hidden Kingdom** call them, "The Shifted," are not necessarily evil and do not side with the **Blood Gnomes**. The **Shifted** are believed to be the diseased spawn of a dying harvest god. No two **Shifted** share complete anatomical similarity; they have differing numbers of limbs and features. Most of these superficial discrepancies are minor, like weirdly shaped teeth or tufts of hair in strange places. Their internal structure is pure chaos, with organs being placed in barely comprehensible places, and bones and joints barely following a clear structure. Gnomes have a very high infant mortality rate. Meanwhile, the **Silent Ones**, beasts of malformed, brutal appearance, ravage the lands scarred by the **Interlocking**.

## _Deep_

The **Hidden Kingdom** used to look as described in older tales. It is an infinite realm, and its origin is unknown. The **Interlocking** caused the recursive architectural and geological features called **Faults**. **Silent Ones** inhabit **Faults**. It is unknown why. **Silent Ones** often escape the **Hidden Kingdom** and become **Demons** in the outer world.

**Kuutar** and **Päivätär** used to inhabit the **Hidden Kingdom**. The **Hidden Kingdom**, in its infinity, connects to **Infinite Worlds**, most of which seem to be barren death traps. Those who visit the **Hidden Kingdom** experience an illness often called "Hidden Fever." It muddles thoughts and causes severe hallucinations. It often causes travelers to accidentally kill themselves in the bizarre geography of the kingdom.

The kingdom extends infinitely in every direction and is comprised of floating, mountainous, and lush islands, dotted with bizarre ancient architecture, resembling that of classical culture. Clouds shine brightly, so most islands are perfectly illuminated.

## _Truth_

The **Hidden Kingdom** was created as a prison for the unintended offspring of **Truth**, **Päivätär**, and **Kuutar**. Its original name was **"Ikuisuus"**, but its prisoners would call it something akin to **"The Falsehood"**, which would eventually deform into **"The Lie"**, **"The Hidden"**, and so on.

The **Hidden Kingdom**, despite being Infinitely large, will eventually become dust, as the floating islands collide with each other unto eternity.

The **Hidden Kingdom** was believed by **Truth** to be a perfect prison, as **Truth** did not know of the existence of the **"Dream Catcher"**, also known as **\*"That Which Ends But Does Not Start"**, **"Death of the Fatespinners"**, **"Hare of a Thousand Feet"**, **"Black Quill of Oblivion"**, **"Toothless Maw of The Chaos God"**, **"Key for No Door"**, **"Snake of the World"**, **"Scum"**, **"Sinistral Side of the Wheel of Time"**, **"Arms of Oblivion"**, **"That Which Stayed the Dragon's Heart"**, **"First and Last Link in the Chain"**, **"End of Eternal Return"**, **"Promiscuous Annihilation"**, **"Pain in Perpetuity"**, **"Death Indiscriminate"**, **"Ambition"**, **"Destruction"**, **"Last Song Unsung"\***.
The **Dream Catcher** broke **Kuutar** out of the **Hidden Kingdom**.

**Ikuisuus** was barren for long, but the bastard children of **Truth** would eventually populate it through asexual reproduction. Beasts known as **Hiisi** were birthed there by **Päivätär**, which would eventually become **Silent Ones** after being cursed by **Kuutar** for slaying their offspring. Some **Hiisi** escaped the **Hidden Kingdom** through a strange bargain with the **Dream Catcher**. This act is known as **"The Grand Sin"**. It sparked years of bickering and conflict between the siblings.

The **Silent Ones** now roam the **Interlocking Faults** in search of a way to reunite with **Päivätär** and hunt down **Kuutar**. **Silent Ones** are fully capable of speech, although they speak in murmurs, and are extremely clever and malicious creatures, even if they pretend to be dumb. **Gnomes** are just **Pieni** that were affected by the **Interlocking** and were brutally deformed as a result, which explains their size and anatomical discrepancies.
