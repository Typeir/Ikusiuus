# **The Holy Empire of the Brume:**

## _Knowledge tiers_

### _Common_

The **Brume** functions as a theocratic society, but there is no widespread faith beyond the belief that to leave a mark on the land is to taint it, and thus one must conceal their flesh from the world. Their philosophy is often referred to as "The Miracle."

The **Brume** is a highly militarized vigilance society, its army only beaten in headcount by that of the **Binturae** of the north. Citizens of the **Brume** wear highly ornamental clothing and rarely expose their skin when outside.

In the **Brume**, to bleed or leave a mark of oneself in public spaces is considered a great offense and is often punished with brutal violence. Criminals can choose to work in the mines below the city to avoid being violently punished by the city guards.

City Guards are known as **Comanda** or **Teachers**. They hold an oath of silence, and their interventions, though uncommon, rarely end with something other than violence.

The city holds uncountable public activities of all kinds, most of them free, although for a pittance of coin one can get a premium spot. There are public banquets held in every church as soon as dawn comes.

The **Brume** is a slave state, but it does not trade its slaves.

The **Brume** established itself as a superpower after it defeated the **Binturean** federation and the "kingdom" of **Cavar** in a herculean war effort known as **The war of the Mists**

### _Advanced_

The **Brume's** highest title is "**The Benefactor**". Their name is never disclosed, but they usually reach this title very late in their life, and are usually males. The **Benefactor's** personal bodyguard is known as the **High Magii**, usually groups of three or four sorcerer swordsmen, although the position is currently held by just one. Their identity is undisclosed.

The mines under the city are inhabited by the **Bilupines**, self-recreating stone constructs resembling two large mastiffs sharing a single humanoid body. The **Bilupines** are enslaved by the **Brume**, although some managed to escape and settle along the **Brumish** plains of South Eclestia.

There are three factions in the political sphere of **The Brume**: the **Despots** or **Traditionalists**, who are conservative in nature; the **Pentients**, a faction of military higher-ups that want to get rid of the **Miracle** beliefs and the **Benefactor** system altogether, transforming the **Brume** into a military republic-empire; and the **Golden Ones**, who believe the **Miracle** to be a deformed version of the **Päivätär** faith, and are the main proponents of the invasion of the southern states. There's also an ambassador to **The Benefactor** that's a part of the **Bilupine**, although not much is disclosed about him.

The **Cult of Kuutar** is strictly forbidden in the **Brume**, as its bloodletting practices and worship of childbirth are in stark contrast to **The Miracle**. The **Brume** is believed to have been founded by religious pilgrims who lost their faith upon finding such a geological formation and became scholars.

---

### _Deep_

The **Bilupine** ambassador the was given the honorary title of **Lord**, which means that he is considered the sole owner of himself. **Lordship** can only be granted to slaves and is seen as a halfway point between commonership and nobility, where commoners are considered property of the state and in servitude to the state, and nobles are considered not in service to the state but its property.

**Lords** are not considered a property of the state, but to attain **Lordship** they must swear fealty to the **Brume**, effectively rendering them special military and political assets. **Lordship** is often referred to as "Second Enslavement," and most of them attempt to flee the city when faced with the choice to become a **Lord**. The **Bilupine** ambassador's name is **Romo**, and he was a leader for the **Bilupine** before being granted **Lordship**.

The **Bilupines** do not age, as they are constructs, and the ambassador was the first-ever **Lord**.

The current **High Magus** is the sole survivor of a terrorist attack of unknown origin, the other three **Magii** were killed.

---

### _Truth_

The other three **Magii** were killed by **Romo** and the surviving **Magus**, as a ploy to weaken all the factions except the **Penitents**, who, in exchange, would undo the slave status of the **Bilupine** were they to reach governance over the **Empire**. They would not, however, stop the expansionist wars in the north and south of **Thule**.

The surviving **Magus** is **Miekka Hirvi**, daughter of **Hirvi of the Storm Fist**, renowned martial artist from **Anthule**, and sister to **Ukko Hirvi**, militiaman from **Borossa**.

The mesa above which the **Sanctuary City** rests was built by the **Bilupine** long before the **Brume** was established, and is not a geological formation. It connects to **Thealas**, but its lower halls are roamed by **The Chase** still.

The city was originally funded over a decamillenial ago by rogues and mercenaries guided by **Gorgias**, third lord of the Dead and ruler of **Taeda**. **Gorgias** conspired with **Xanthous** in an attempt to reach the **world-seed** by forcing the **Empyreans** to use the **Blade of Damocles**. The city was destroyed by the demon **Xanthous** after his plans were thwarted by the Smith warriors of legend. Millenia later, a regretful **Xanthous** re-built the city, creating the faith of **The Miracles** and making sure his rogue state would not fail him this time.

The **Bilupine** are old mason and warrior constructs from the **Empyrean Empire**, but they were put in a deep slumber after **The Scarring**. The new **Brume** was founded by a group of mercenaries and adventurers trying to get to the **Scar**, which ended up settling on top of the vast **Brume Mesa**, halfway to the **Scar**, and not by pilgrims as it is believed.

## **1. The Society and Structure of the Brume**

The **Holy Empire of the Brume** is a theocratic society unlike any other in **Damocles**. Its philosophy, known as **The Miracle**, is the cornerstone of its entire social, legal, and spiritual framework. In the **Brume**, the notion that the human body is a source of corruption underpins all aspects of life, as the miracles dictate that no human or humanoid shall leave marks of their flesh or body on this world. Citizens are required to live by stringent codes of behavior, and violations of these codes are punished with extreme severity.

# **1.1 The Doctrine of The Miracle**

At the heart of **The Brume’s** belief system is **The Miracle**, a doctrine that views the human body as an alien entity to the natural world, one that is inherently corrupt and impure. Unlike other societies in **Damocles**, where exposure of the body is seen as part of the natural order, the **Brume** takes a radically different approach. In **Brumish** thought, the human body, with its flesh, blood, and fluids, is a contaminant, and its presence defiles the natural purity of the world. Thus, the citizens of the **Brume** are required to take extreme measures to prevent their bodies from leaving any trace in public spaces.

The notion of purity here is strictly connected to the avoidance of contamination by the self. The human body must not "leave a mark" upon the land, and any such action is seen as a profound act of blasphemy. It is forbidden to bleed, shed skin, or expose too much of one’s body in public. This philosophy has resulted in a society where individuals are heavily concealed in garments that cover most of, or the entirety of their flesh, creating a visual culture of concealment, modesty, and separation from the natural world. The citizens wear highly ornamental clothing, often layered in intricate designs that simultaneously hide their bodies and serve as symbols of status. These clothes are not simply fashion statements, but active markers of compliance with **The Miracle**.

# **1.2 Public Behavior and Law**

The public life of the **Brume** is one governed by rigid social norms, where violations of public conduct are met with brutal and immediate consequences. The city operates on a strict code of behavior derived from the theological principles of **The Miracle**, dictating how citizens should interact with one another and with their surroundings. Social etiquette revolves around the avoidance of physical interaction with the environment. Citizens must be careful not to leave behind any physical remnants of themselves, such as hair, skin, or bodily fluids, in public places. Even a drop of blood in a public square is considered a grave offense.

This rigorous enforcement of bodily control has led to an unusual public space dynamic. Public squares, markets, and temples are pristine, free from the litter and grime common in other cities of **Damocles**. Cleanliness is not simply a preference, but a spiritual imperative. Every citizen is constantly aware of their body’s potential to defile the sacred public spaces, which cultivates a culture of hyper-awareness and control over one’s actions.

The **Brume** employs a class of enforcers known as the **Comanda**, or **Teachers**, to ensure that these laws are upheld. The **Comanda** are sworn to silence, representing the most visible form of state authority in the **Brume**. They do not speak, as verbal engagement is seen as unnecessary for their role. Their presence alone is a reminder of the laws that govern the **Brume**, and their interventions are swift and violent. If a citizen is found guilty of leaving a physical mark on the city—whether by bleeding, shedding skin, or defiling the environment in any other way—they are often met with brutal punishment on the spot.

# **1.3 The Comanda**

The **Comanda** are more than just law enforcers; they are the embodiment of **The Miracle’s** core tenet of purity. Their silence is a deliberate rejection of the corrupting potential of human speech, as even words are considered a form of contamination. By taking an oath of silence, the **Comanda** align themselves with the state’s ideal of spiritual and physical purity. Their violence is seen as a necessary action to cleanse the public space from the contamination of the human body.

Their interventions in daily life are rare but always violent. If someone is caught violating the strictures of public conduct, they are often punished immediately, with no need for formal trials or public hearings. This allows the **Comanda** to function with an efficiency that reinforces the empire’s desire for absolute order. They serve not only as enforcers of the law but also as spiritual guardians of the city’s sanctity.

Though their power is largely unchecked, the **Comanda** rarely abuse their authority in an arbitrary manner. Rather, their acts of violence are calculated, symbolic actions meant to maintain social and spiritual order. Their loyalty to the **Benefactor** and the ideals of the state make them feared and respected in equal measure.

# **1.4 The Benefactor and the High Magii**

At the top of the **Brume’s** power structure sits the **Benefactor**, an anonymous figure who is believed to embody the spiritual authority of the empire. The **Benefactor’s** identity is a closely guarded secret, and they are often chosen late in life, usually males who have served in the empire’s spiritual and military institutions for decades. The **Benefactor** serves as both a religious leader and a political figure, their authority unchallenged and absolute.

The **Benefactor** is protected by a special class of sorcerer-swordsmen known as the **High Magii**. These individuals are not only masters of martial and magical arts but also spiritual figures tasked with preserving the empire’s religious integrity. Traditionally, there are three or four **Magii** at any given time, but in recent history, only one remains—**Miekka Hirvi**, a former gladiator turned war counselor.

**Miekka Hirvi**’s rise to power is emblematic of the complex and often contradictory nature of **Brumish** society. Once sold into slavery by her father **Hirvi of the Storm Fist**, **Miekka** fought in the brutal arenas of the city’s underworld, where gladiators battled for their lives.

**Hirvi of the Storm Fist** was a man who believed that the only currency of value was strength. His superiority in combat had shaped his worldview, leading him to see his daughter as a potential tool to further his own legacy. He had no qualms about selling her to the **Brumean slave traders** who frequently scoured the economically unstable southern regions of **Anthule** for children. For **Hirvi**, this was not a loss but a test, a way for **Miekka** to prove herself in the only way he deemed meaningful: through survival and battle.

Her victories earned her freedom and later **Lordship**, a status that allowed her to navigate the intricate power structures of the **Brume**. Through a combination of political acumen and martial prowess, she rose to become the sole surviving **High Magus** after a mysterious attack that killed the other three members of her order.

**Miekka** now wields immense power, both as a political figure and as the **Benefactor’s** protector. Her presence in the **Benefactor’s** court is both feared and revered, as she represents the ability of those from even the lowest social strata to ascend to positions of great influence within the empire. Yet her loyalty remains suspect, and some believe she harbors ambitions that go far beyond her current position.

# **1.5 Political Factions and the Power Struggles of the Brume**

Beneath the outward appearance of spiritual unity, the **Brume** is rife with political factions, each vying for control over the future direction of the empire. The tension between these factions reflects the competing visions for the **Brume’s** future. The **Despots**, **Penitents**, and **Golden Ones** represent the primary factions within the political landscape, and their competing ideologies shape the internal dynamics of the empire.

- **The Despots** advocate for the preservation of **The Miracle** as the guiding principle of the state, seeing any deviation from the current order as a threat to the empire’s spiritual and moral foundation.
- **The Penitents**, by contrast, reject **The Miracle** and seek to transform the **Brume** into a militaristic republic, focusing on expansionist policies and the abolition of slavery, including the emancipation of the **Bilupine**.
- **The Golden Ones** offer a more religiously complex vision, advocating for a reformation of the **Miracle**, which they see as a corrupted version of the **Päivätär** faith, while also supporting imperial expansion into southern territories.

These factions constantly compete for influence, with shifting alliances and secretive power plays defining the political landscape of the **Brume**. This internal discord belies the outward image of a unified theocratic state, highlighting the inherent tensions between spiritual purity and political ambition.

## **2. The Forgotten History of the Sanctuary City and the Black Halls**

The **Sanctuary City of the Brume**'s origins are far more complex and steeped in myth than most of its citizens understand. Far from the unified theocratic society it is today, the **Brume** began as a rogue state—a rebellion founded in secret under the influence of an ancient and powerful demon known as **Xanthous**, one of the four prominent **Hiisi** or demons of **Damocles**. The city’s foundation and early development were driven by cosmic forces far beyond human comprehension, with **Xanthous** at the center of it all, conspiring to create a power that would eventually jailbreak him from his **clone-world**.

# **2.1 The Hiisi and Xanthous: Demonic Origins of the Brume**

The **Hiisi**—a name given to demons in the southern states of **Thule** and **Anthule**—are often regarded as little more than tricksters or malevolent spirits in popular folklore. They are believed to be beings who strike bargains with mortals, granting them wealth, power, or health in exchange for their souls or a portion of their lifeforce. During harvest seasons, many rural villages still perform theatrical representations of the tale of the four **Hiisi** that wounded the world: the black one representing death, the white one representing growth, the yellow one representing enlightenment, and the red one representing power. However, these festivals mask a deeper, more sinister truth—one that has long been forgotten by most of **Damocles**.

In reality, the **Hiisi** are far more than folklore. They are the bastard offspring of the sun god **Päivätär**, creatures of immense power who were cast away within the **Hidden Kingdom** long ago. After the event known as the **Interlocking**, the **Hiisi** split into two factions: those who stayed behind in the twisted ruins of the **Hidden Kingdom**, becoming known as the **Silent Ones**, and those who escaped into the mortal world, becoming the demons that mortals now fear and bargain with.

Among the **Hiisi** that escaped, four were especially prominent: **Nigredo**, **Albedo**, **Xanthous**, and **Rubedo**. These four demons were scions of the **Dream Catcher**, having heard its call through the veil that separates **Damocles** from the **Hidden Kingdom**. Each of these demons had their own ambitions, and each played a role in shaping the course of human history, particularly in the event's leading to the **Scarring**, and it's aftermath. Of these four, **Xanthous** was the one most responsible for the rise of the **Sacred Brume Empire**.

# **2.2 Xanthous and the Foundation of the Brume**

**Xanthous**, the yellow demon, was the embodiment of ambition, conspiracy, and manipulation. His influence in the founding of the **Sanctuary City of the Brume** cannot be understated. In his attempt to return the **Dream Catcher**—the god of destruction and ambition—back to its rightful owner, the **White Homunculus**, **Xanthous** sought to establish a rogue state that could serve as a focal point for the civil war that would ensure the **Blade of Damocles** be used. This rogue state would eventually become the **Brume**, but its origins were born out of demonic scheming rather than human agency.

The mesa upon which the **Sanctuary City** now stands was not chosen for its defensibility alone. **Xanthous** conspired with **Gorgias**, the Duke of **Taeda**, to establish a fortress atop this artificial mesa. The mesa itself was constructed by the **Bilupine** under duress, but the design was guided by **Xanthous**’ subtle manipulations. **Gorgias** was an ambitious ruler, hungry for power and independence from the crumbling **Empyrean Empire**, and **Xanthous** exploited this ambition, coaxing him into his plan to break into the **world-seed**. Together, they would establish a rogue state and start an unnoficial, undeclared war with the **Empyrean Empire**.

The early history of the **Brume** was marked by conflict with the **Empyrean Empire**, particularly with its capital, **Thealas**. The **Eternal Stairwell**, a massive stairwell spiraling down from the innards of mesa into the underground caverns, to the **Black Halls** and the old state of **Thealas**, became the site of numerous skirmishes between the forces of the **Brume** and imperial soldiers. However, these battles were not fought purely for territorial control; they were part of a larger cosmic struggle orchestrated by **Xanthous**. By fostering rebellion and conflict, **Xanthous** hoped to create enough chaos and suffering to force the hand of the empire into using **The Valve of the World**, and activate the **Blade of Damocles**, thus allowing him to escape into the **world-seed**. But alas, the valve was sealed, and the **Dream Catcher** found it's way into the hands of a young girl named **Annabelle**, Daughter of the **Blood Knight** Ludwig, son of the Moon.

# **2.3 The Eternal Stair: From Connection to Conflict**

The **Eternal Stairwell** is one of the most enigmatic structures in the **Sanctuary City of the Brume**. Built long before the founding of the city itself, the stairwell was originally a conduit constructed by the **Bilupine**, connected the mesa to the heart of **Thealas** in the days of the **Empyrean Empire**. It was once a symbol of unity and collaboration between the various city-states of the empire, allowing for trade, diplomacy, and easy access to the surface from the underground, and vice-versa.

However, as the **Brume** broke away from the empire, the stairwell became a site of conflict. Skirmishes between the forces of **Thealas** and the rogue state were frequent, with much of the fighting taking place along the winding passages of the **Eternal Stair**. These battles, while seemingly driven by political and territorial ambitions, were, in fact, orchestrated by **Xanthous** as part of his larger plan to destabilize the empire and create a new power center in the form of the **Brume**.

The **Eternal Stair** itself is a testament to the craftsmanship of the **Bilupine**, with intricate carvings depicting the early history of the **Empyrean Empire** and the gods that ruled over it. Yet, this stairwell is more than just a historical relic; it is also a symbol of the demonic influence that shaped the city’s early history. The **Bilupine** who built it were enslaved by human rulers, but their designs were subtly guided by **Xanthous**, whose manipulations ensured that the stairwell would become a focal point for the conflict and chaos he sought to foster.

# **2.4 The Decline of the Empyrean Empire and the Rise of the Brume**

The turning point in the history of the **Sanctuary City** came with the collapse of the **Empyrean Empire**. Beset by internal strife, external threats, and natural disasters, the empire gradually lost control over its outer territories, including the mesa where the **Brume** had been established. As the empire weakened, **Xanthous** took full advantage, pushing the leaders of the **Brume** to assert their independence and expand their influence.

The fall of the **Empyrean Empire** allowed the **Brume** to solidify its control over the mesa and the surrounding lands, transforming from a rogue state into a fully independent military power. Yet, even as the city grew in power, the demonic influence of **Xanthous** remained hidden in the background, quietly guiding the actions of the city’s leaders.

# **2.5 The Eternal Stair’s Abandonment and the Chase**

As the **City-State** solidified its place in the world, the **Eternal Stair** fell into disuse. What was once a grand passage linking the mesa to the heart of the empire became a forgotten relic of a bygone era. Over time, the stairwell became a place of fear, its dark, humid corridors haunted by a vicious creature known as **The Chase**—a black, predatory beast that now roams its depths. Few dare to descend into the stairwell, as those who do often never return. The presence of **The Chase** is a reminder of the darker forces at play in the city’s history, and some speculate that it is a manifestation of **Xanthous**’ lingering influence.

The abandonment of the **Eternal Stair** marked the end of the city’s direct connection to its imperial past. No longer tied to the **Empyrean Empire**, the **Brume** had become a self-contained entity, focused on its own spiritual and political ambitions.

---

## **3. The Bilupine**

The **Bilupine**, sentient stone constructs resembling two large mastiffs sharing a humanoid body, have long been associated with the deep history of the **Empyrean Empire** and the construction of the **Sanctuary City of the Brume**. Although much of the city’s modern theocratic rule centers around its doctrines of purity and spiritual governance, the foundation of the **Brume** was built upon the labor and exploitation of the **Bilupine**. Yet, their role in the city’s history is not merely one of servitude—like much in the **Brume**, their legacy is interwoven with the machinations of the **Hiisi**, particularly **Xanthous**, whose influence ensured that the **Bilupine** became integral to the creation of a rogue state that would one day become the **Sacred Empire of the Brume**.

# **3.1 From Builders of the Empire to Slaves of the Brume**

The **Bilupine** were not always slaves. In the early days of the **Empyrean Empire**, they were revered for their craftsmanship and their contributions to the construction of the empire’s cities, fortifications, and monuments. These sentient stone beings were created as part of the empire’s grand vision of expansion, tasked with building the infrastructure that would allow the **Empyrean Empire** to dominate much of the known world. Their labor was tireless, and their ability to manipulate stone and earth was unmatched, making them invaluable to the empire’s rulers.

However, the **Bilupine** were not merely tools; they possessed sentience and the capacity for complex thought. Although created by the **Empyrean Empire**, they had their own culture, their own understanding of the world, and their own form of governance. The **Bilupine** were long-lived, immune to disease, aging, and many of the physical limitations that plagued their human counterparts. This gave them a unique perspective on the passage of time, and though they were bound to the empire, they were aware of their importance, even if this didn't make them any less servile.

As the empire began to crumble under the weight of internal strife and external threats, the role of the **Bilupine** shifted. They were no longer revered as artisans and craftsmen; instead, they became tools of the state, enslaved by the rulers of the **Brume**, who saw their labor as essential to the city’s continued expansion. The **Bilupine** were forced into the mines and tunnels beneath the mesa, working ceaselessly to extract resources and maintain the infrastructure of the city. This enslavement was not simply a product of human ambition but was part of a broader plan orchestrated by **Xanthous**, whose influence ensured that the **Bilupine** would play a key role in the creation of the **Sanctuary City**.

# **3.2 Xanthous and the Enslavement of the Bilupine**

**Xanthous**, as one of the four prominent **Hiisi** who escaped the **Hidden Kingdom**, was instrumental in the establishment of the **Brume** as a rogue state. His influence extended far beyond simple manipulation of human rulers—he also sought to subjugate the **Bilupine**, who had been instrumental in the construction of the **Empyrean Empire**. By ensuring that the **Bilupine** were enslaved and forced to work beneath the city, **Xanthous** guaranteed that the foundation of the **Brume** would be built on the exploitation of sentient beings. This exploitation served **Xanthous’** larger goal of fostering chaos and conflict, as the suffering of the **Bilupine** would contribute to the unraveling of the **Empyrean Empire**.

The **Bilupine**, though powerful in their own right, were no match for the forces arrayed against them. Enslaved by the rulers of the **Brume**, they became an integral part of the city’s growth and development. Their stone bodies allowed them to work in conditions that would have been impossible for human laborers, and their knowledge of stonecraft ensured that the city’s infrastructure was maintained and expanded with precision. However, their sentience made their enslavement all the more tragic—they were fully aware of their plight, and many **Bilupine** grew bitter and resentful of their human oppressors.

# **3.3 The Bilupine’s Role in the Construction of the Mesa and the Eternal Stairwell**

The mesa upon which the **Sanctuary City of the Brume** was built is not a natural geological formation—it was constructed by the **Bilupine** long before the founding of the city. Under the influence of **Xanthous**, the early rulers of the **Brume** enslaved the **Bilupine** and forced them to shape the mesa into an impregnable fortress. The **Bilupine**’s skill in stonecraft made this feat possible, and their labor ensured that the mesa would become a symbol of the city’s power and independence.

The **Eternal Stair**, a spiraling stairwell that connects the mesa to the caverns and tunnels below, was also built by the **Bilupine**. Originally intended as a means of connecting the **Sanctuary City** to the heart of the **Empyrean Empire** in **Thealas**, the **Eternal Stair** was later repurposed as a defensive structure during the skirmishes between the **Brume** and imperial forces. The stairwell’s grand design, with it's massive stone pillars and opressive, barren architecture, is a testament to the **Bilupine**’s craftsmanship, but it is also a symbol of their subjugation.

Despite their enslavement, the **Bilupine** continued to play a vital role in the city’s growth and development. Their labor allowed the rulers of the **Brume** to expand their influence and fortify their defenses, but their treatment as slaves bred resentment among the **Bilupine** community. Over time, this resentment would simmer, and some **Bilupine** would seek to escape their bondage, fleeing to the **Brumish** plains or hiding in the deeper tunnels beneath the city.

# **3.4 The Lordship of Romo and the Bilupine’s Struggle for Autonomy**

One of the most notable figures among the **Bilupine** is **Romo**, a former leader who was granted **Lordship** by the rulers of the **Brume**. This title, which elevated **Romo** above the status of a common slave, allowed him a degree of autonomy and recognition within the rigid hierarchy of the city. However, his **Lordship** came at a cost—**Romo** was required to swear fealty to the state, effectively binding him to the service of the city’s rulers.

While **Romo’s** title of **Lord** granted him privileges, such as the ability to own property and move freely within the city, it also isolated him from his fellow **Bilupine**, who viewed his allegiance to the state with suspicion. To some of the **Bilupine** still laboring in the mines and tunnels, **Romo** was seen as a traitor, someone who had sold out his own kind in exchange for personal gain. Despite his efforts to advocate for the interests of the **Bilupine**, **Romo** is not fully trusted by either the human rulers of the city or his own people.

## **4. Xanthous and the Foundations of the Brume**

The history of the **Sanctuary City of the Brume** is complex and ancient, stretching back millennia before its rise as a powerful theocratic superpower. What many of its modern citizens may not realize is that the city was once nothing more than a rogue military state—void of spiritual purpose, driven by ambition and expansion. It was destroyed in a catastrophic event over 10,000 years ago, an act of demonic wrath led by the **Hiisi** known as **Xanthous**. However, the city was rebuilt by survivors and pilgrims, who saw the fall of their militaristic past as divine punishment for their moral corruption. This belief was heavily influenced by **Xanthous**, who, despite his initial rage, devised a new plan to escape his cosmic bindings, and this plan continues to shape the **Brume** to this day.

# **4.1 Xanthous and the Blade of Damocles**

**Xanthous** is one of the four prominent **Hiisi**, or demons, of **Damocles**—beings not born of ambition but consumed by hatred for their progenitors, the **Dragon** and the **Sun God** **Päivätär**, who they view as having abandoned them. Though not blood-related to the **Dream Catcher**, these demonic scions found themselves aligned with its interests due to their shared desire for cosmic upheaval. The **Hiisi** broke from their divine roots long ago, driven by resentment toward their forebears. **Xanthous**, the yellow demon, represents the most manipulative of his kin, using humans and non-humans alike as tools to enact his revenge.

The **Sanctuary City of the Brume** originally served as a military stronghold, a rogue state forged by the **Hiisi** to oppose the **Empyreans**. **Xanthous** saw the potential in this nascent power and manipulated its leaders, guiding them toward a singular purpose: to activate the **Blade of Damocles**. This ancient device, according to legend, could pierce the boundaries between the **Clone-Worlds** and the **World-Seed**, allowing those who used it to reach a deeper truth. However, the blade's power came at a devastating price. Activating the blade would mortally wound the world itself, causing immense destruction and chaos.

**Xanthous** believed that by activating the **Blade of Damocles**, he could tear open the leaves of the tree of fate and escape the constraints of his **Damocles** to enter the **World-Seed**, and reunite the dark horse of ambition with it's fated owner. The **City of the Brume**, with its strategic position and military strength, was to be the site of this grand plan, its leaders blinded by their lust for power, unaware they were pawns in a much larger game.

# **4.2 The Thwarting of Xanthous by Grommush**

The culmination of the **Hiisi's** plan seemed inevitable, but it was ultimately thwarted by **Grommush**, a legendary dwarven smith, counselor to the council of the capital of **Thealas**. **Grommush** had no inherent power beyond his remarkable skill in crafting. However, being the architect of the **Valve of the World**, he was in the frontlines of the **Brume-Thealasian war**, and in an act of great sacrifice, managed to seal the valve and break the handle, stopping **Blade of Damocles**, but bringing ruin to the inner contintent of **Thealas**, and kickstarting the **Scarring** and the **Eternity of the four**. This, however, is not true for all **clone-worlds**, as the **Pieni** are unique creatures. There was but one **Grommush**, and other **clone-worlds** would be irreparably devastated when the blade was activated, as it malfunctioned when it wasn't simultaneously activated in all **clone-worlds**. **Some** other worlds were saved by similar acts of heroicism, but by others, such as **Ra'el** royal blacksmith.

# **4.3 Xanthous' Rage and the Fall of the Brume**

Though **Xanthous'** plan was foiled, his wrath was far from diminished. Having spent centuries cultivating the **Brume** as the site of his escape, he was furious that a mere mortal had undone his scheme. In a mad rage, **Xanthous** unleashed his full destructive power upon the city. The **City of the Brume**, once a symbol of military might and unchecked ambition, was obliterated. Its towering fortresses crumbled to dust, and the city’s people were either killed or driven into exile.

The destruction of the **Brume** was absolute. The city, which had once been a hub of regional power, was reduced to ruins. The military elite who had ruled the city were wiped out, and the survivors were scattered across **Damocles**, carrying with them tales of their city’s downfall. Some whispered of **Xanthous’** involvement, though many believed that the destruction was the result of their unchecked hedonism and lack of faith. In the aftermath of the cataclysm, **Xanthous** disappeared from the ruins, his plans thwarted but his influence far from extinguished.

# **4.4 The Rebirth of the Brume**

For thousands of years, the ruins of the original **City of the Brume** lay abandoned, a scar upon the landscape. It was not until long after the fall of the **Empyrean Empire** that the **Brume** was rebuilt, but its rebirth came from a radically different vision. The survivors and their descendants, wandering the lands in exile, became pilgrims. They believed that the destruction of their home was divine punishment for their hubris and moral corruption. Influenced by their new-found faith, these pilgrims began to adopt the doctrine of **The Miracle**—a philosophy that preached purity, control, and the avoidance of leaving any mark upon the world.

Unbeknownst to these pilgrims, their beliefs were subtly guided by the merciless hand of **Xanthous**. The demon had devised a new plan: rather than attempting to destroy the world outright, he would manipulate the city’s rulers from within, guiding their beliefs and ambitions to conquer the surrounding countires, and once again open the **Valve of the World**. This new strategy would take millennia to bear fruit, but **Xanthous** was nothing if not patient.

# **4.5 The Brume’s Rise as a Theocratic Superpower**

Over time, the newly rebuilt **Sanctuary City of the Brume** transformed into a powerful theocratic state. The survivors of the city’s destruction, now followers of **The Miracle**, enforced a strict spiritual order upon their people. The doctrine of **The Miracle** taught that the human body was tainted and that to leave any trace of oneself—whether blood, skin, or hair—was a sin. This belief system created a rigid society where the exposure of flesh was restricted, and spiritual purity was maintained through extreme discipline.

The newly rebuilt **Brume** became a militaristic superpower, but unlike its predecessor, which had been driven purely by ambition, the new **Brume** was motivated by a fanatical devotion to **The Miracle**. The city expanded its influence across **Damocles**, conquering neighboring territories and spreading its theocratic doctrines. The military might of the **Brume** was formidable, with its soldiers—the **Comanda**—enforcing the strict laws of spiritual purity with ruthless efficiency.

# **4.6 The Hidden Plan of Xanthous**

Though **Xanthous** has not physically appeared in the **Brume** since its destruction 10,000 years ago, his influence remains ever-present. The strict religious order that now governs the city is, after all, the result of his manipulations. By guiding the survivors of the original city toward a belief in **The Miracle**, **Xanthous** ensured that the new **Brume** would be a society obsessed with control and purity, a land so zealous it would never be stopped by the warning signs and cautionary tales of the old world.

The **Brume**’s rigid relegious rule, combined with its relentless military expansion, has created a volatile environment where ambition and repression exist in constant tension. This tension, nurtured by **Xanthous**, is part of the demon’s larger plan to weaken the barriers between the **Clone-Worlds** and the **World-Seed**. While the leaders of the **Brume** believe they are working to purify the world, they are, in fact, unwittingly advancing **Xanthous'** agenda. Though it may take centuries or even millennia, **Xanthous** is patient, and he knows that the **Brume** will once again serve as the key to his escape.

## **5. The Present-Day Brume**

The **Sanctuary City of the Brume**, now a powerful militaristic theocracy, is a complex tapestry woven from the threads of its tumultuous past and the competing ambitions of its present. The city’s rise to power has led to the establishment of various political factions, each with its own ideologies, ambitions, and strategies for influence. These factions exist within a rigid societal structure that is heavily influenced by the doctrines of **The Miracle** and the haunting legacy of the **Hiisi**, particularly the manipulations of **Xanthous**.

# **5.1 The Theocratic Structure of the Brume**

At the heart of the **Brume**’s governance lies its theocratic structure, where power is vested in a combination of spiritual leaders and military commanders. The supreme authority is held by the **Benefactor**, an enigmatic figure whose identity is shrouded in secrecy. This individual embodies both the religious and temporal authority of the **Brume**, leading the city under the strictures of **The Miracle**. The **Benefactor** is advised and protected by the **High Magii**, a council of sorcerer-swordsmen who uphold the spiritual integrity of the state.

The **Comanda**, or **Teachers**, are the state's law enforcement, maintaining order through intimidation and violence. They are bound by an oath of silence, their presence alone often sufficient to deter dissent. This rigid structure creates an environment where fear and devotion coexist, and where loyalty to the state is paramount.

# **5.2 Political Factions**

Despite the apparent unity of the **Brume**, the city is rife with political factions that vie for power and influence. These factions reflect the complex interplay of ambition, ideology, and the lingering effects of the ancient cosmic struggles that have shaped the world.

- **The Despots**: This faction is comprised of traditionalists who advocate for the preservation of **The Miracle** as the guiding principle of the **Brume**. They view any deviation from the established order as a threat to the spiritual and moral foundation of the state. The **Despots** are often wealthy landowners or influential clergy who benefit from the current regime and are determined to maintain the status quo. Their motivations are often self-serving, rooted in a desire for power and control.

- **The Penitents**: In contrast, the **Penitents** are a faction of military leaders who seek to abolish the strictures of **The Miracle**. They argue for a transformation of the **Brume** into a militaristic republic, focusing on expansionism and the potential emancipation of the **Bilupine**. They see the **Miracle** as a burden that hampers the city’s potential for growth and dominance. The **Penitents** believe that the **Brume** must embrace its martial nature and seek to conquer neighboring territories to ensure its survival and prosperity.

- **The Golden Ones**: This faction comprises religious reformers who believe that **The Miracle** is a distorted version of the **Päivätär** faith. They advocate for a return to the core tenets of their ancestral beliefs, emphasizing enlightenment, growth, and the importance of balance in the cosmos. The **Golden Ones** also support expansionist policies, arguing that the **Brume** should actively seek to bring the southern states under its influence, thereby spreading their version of faith.

These factions are often in conflict with one another, their interactions marked by intrigue, betrayal, and shifting alliances. The political landscape of the **Brume** is ever-changing, and power struggles are a constant feature of life in the city.

# **5.3 The Influence of Xanthous**

While the **Brume**’s current leadership operates under the belief that they are acting in the best interests of their people, they are unwittingly playing into the hands of **Xanthous**. The demon, though absent from the mortal plane since the destruction of the original city, continues to exert his influence through the ambitions and desires of those who seek power within the **Brume**.

**Xanthous** has subtly woven his manipulations into the very fabric of the city’s political dynamics. By fostering competition between the factions, he seeks to create an environment of instability and chaos. This chaos serves to weaken the bonds of order that the **Brume** strives to maintain, opening pathways for the **Hiisi** and their ambitions to further unravel the very structure of the city.

The **Hiisi**, particularly **Xanthous**, thrive on chaos, and their manipulations encourage the **Despots**, **Penitents**, and **Golden Ones** to pursue their agendas with fervor. This tension creates a volatile political climate where the potential for rebellion or upheaval is always present, allowing **Xanthous** to set his plans in motion once again.

The **Brume’s** obsession with purity and control, its strict religious doctrines, and its fanatical devotion to maintaining order all reflect a deeper cosmic struggle that has shaped the world since time immemorial.

For the people of the **Brume**, these ancient forces are invisible, their origins lost to time. The city’s rulers believe they are acting in accordance with divine will, enforcing the doctrines of **The Miracle** to maintain spiritual purity and control over the lands of **Damocles**. However, beneath the surface, the tensions between creation and destruction, order and chaos, continue to shape the fate of the inhabitants of **Damocles**—just as they have shaped the fate of **Damocles** for millions of years.

In this way, the **Brume** stands at the intersection of ancient cosmic forces that it can no longer comprehend. The destruction of the original city, the rise of the new theocratic state, and the subtle influence of **Xanthous** all speak to the lingering effects of a conflict that began long before the first mortal civilizations emerged. While the people the **Brume** may not know the story of the **Dragon**, they are, in many ways, living out its legacy.

# **5.4 The Bilupine**

Amidst the political struggles of the **Brume**, the **Bilupine** serve as both a source of tension and a symbol of hope. Once enslaved laborers who built the original city, the **Bilupine** now find themselves in a precarious position within the social hierarchy of the **Brume**. While some **Bilupine** have achieved **Lordship**, allowing them limited autonomy, the majority remain in servitude, their potential unrealized and their resentment growing.

The **Bilupine** are aware of their own power, both in terms of their skills as builders and their potential as sentient beings. While many have fled the city to form small, nomadic communities, others yearn for freedom and the chance to reclaim their dignity. The current political climate creates an opportunity for the **Bilupine** to rise against their oppressors, but this ambition is fraught with danger.

Some factions within the **Brume**, particularly the **Penitents**, advocate for the emancipation of the **Bilupine**, arguing that their freedom would strengthen the **Brume** militarily and spiritually. Yet, such discussions are often met with resistance from the **Despots**, who view the **Bilupine** as essential tools of the state. The ongoing struggle for the **Bilupine**’s rights and status serves as a microcosm of the larger political conflicts within the **Brume**.

# **5.5 The War of The Mists**

The **Holy Empire of The Brume** is currently the largest active nation in **Damocles**, it's current territorial expansion covering about **15%** of the total inhabitable landmass, it's claims being over **25%** of it. This enormous extension was taken from the **Binturian Federation** and the **Kingdom of Cavar** less than a decade ago, during a **Cataclismic** war known as **The War of the Mists**, named so by the recent usage of gassing devices by the **Brumean** and **Binturian** millitary.

After the war was won in the **Battle for the Moon's Gambit**, the **Binturean** empire lost around **40%** of it's southern territories, which were annexed by **The Brume**, and most of it's inhabitants taken into temporary slavery to rebuild the war damages.

The **Cavari** had no such luck, as blind belief in their monarch, the **Khadesh**, led them to disregard the **Brume's** peace deals, which when rejected, led to the total obliteration of their capital, **Akhaciye**, home of the **Glass Colliseum**, old relic from before the **Scarring**. Most of the dispalced found their way to **Melumbo** or **Borossa**, which in turn would eventually spark another of the **Brume's** expansionist wars.

# **5.6 The Ongoing War with the Borossan Kingdom**

The **Brume** is currently embroiled in an ongoing conflict with the **Borossan Kingdom**, a struggle that has significant implications for the city's military and political landscape. This war is driven by a combination of territorial ambitions, resource competition, and the desire to spread the influence of **The Miracle** beyond its borders.

The **Borossan Kingdom** is predominantly populated by the **Sunborn**, beings who are often regarded by the **Brume** as infra-human creatures. The **Sunborn** are the result of unnatural transformations, cursed by the light and believed to be twisted reflections of humanity. This dehumanization justifies the **Brume's** aggression, allowing its citizens to view the conflict as a sacred duty to purify the world of what they perceive as flawed and corrupt beings.

Historically, the **Borossan Kingdom** has resisted attempts at annexation, fiercely maintaining its independence. The **Brume's** leaders view this conflict as an opportunity to expand their realm and assert dominance in the region, all while framing their military actions as a necessary effort to propagate the doctrines of **The Miracle**.

The conflict has led to a significant mobilization of the **Brume's** military forces, with the **Comanda** deployed in various campaigns against **Borossan** territories. However, the war has proven to be protracted and costly, straining the **Brume's** resources and testing the resolve of its citizens. The ongoing hostilities have also intensified internal debates among the factions within the city.
