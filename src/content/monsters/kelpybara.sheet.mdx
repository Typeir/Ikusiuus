## Traits

- **Trampling Charge**
  - If the **Kelpybara** moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a **Jaws** attack, the creature becomes grappled unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Strength saving throw. Additionally, as a bonus action, the **Kelpybara** can attempt to restrain the creature and itself with a grapple (contested check).

## Actions

- **Jaws**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

## Spellcasting

The **Kelpybara** has two level 2 warlock spell slots and can cast the following spells:

- **Darkness**
  - **Level**: 2 Evocation
  - **Casting Time**: 1 action
  - **Range**: 60 feet
  - **Components**: V M (Bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)
  - **Duration**: Up to 10 minutes

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

- **Misty Step**
  - **Level**: 2 Conjuration
  - **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
  - **Range**: Self
  - **Components**: V
  - **Duration**: Instantaneous

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

Additionally, the creature can cast the following cantrips as a 4th level spellcaster:

- **Eldritch Blast**
  - **Level**: Cantrip Evocation
  - **Casting Time**: 1 action
  - **Range**: 120 feet
  - **Components**: V S
  - **Duration**: Instantaneous

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

## Umbral Spellcasting

While obscured or under the night skies, the **Kelpybara** can ritually cast the following spells. Only one of the spell effects may be active at a time, and it can target only itself:

- **Jump**
  - **Level**: 1 Transmutation
  - **Casting Time**: 1 action
  - **Range**: Touch
  - **Components**: V S M (A grasshopper's hind leg)
  - **Duration**: 1 minute

You touch a creature. The creature’s jump distance is tripled until the spell ends.

- **Water Walk**
  - **Level**: 3 Transmutation
  - **Casting Time**: 1 action
  - **Range**: 30 feet
  - **Components**: V S M (A piece of cork)
  - **Duration**: 1 hour

This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat).

Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration. If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.

- **Expeditious Retreat**
  - **Level**: 1 Transmutation
  - **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
  - **Range**: Self
  - **Components**: V S
  - **Duration**: Up to 10 minutes

This spell allows you to move at an incredible pace. When you cast this spell, and then as a bonus action on each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take the Dash action.
