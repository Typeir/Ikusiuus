# Hound of Tindalos

<BlendedImage src="/library/images/HoundOfTindalos.png" alt="Hound of Tindalos  " />

A lesser hound of the Fold, this being is still dangerous when encountered in places where the veils of reality are thin. It stalks magical activity and slips through the geometry of the world in search of prey marked by temporal anomalies.
