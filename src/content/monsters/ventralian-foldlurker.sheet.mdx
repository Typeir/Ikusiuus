# Ventralian Foldlurker

The **Ventralian Foldlurker** is the **inevitability of written law**, made manifest. It exists not to judge—but to enforce.
Its **mask** reflects the mechanisms that shaped Damocles—the **Canvas**, the **Tree**, the **Cycle**. Behind it is no face, only a void, and inside, a digestive logic that sees only **violation** and **resolution**.
These beings are rare but not unique. They are **record-keepers**, **enforcers**, **severance agents** of the Fold, manifest when the energies of the precursor reach unbearable instability.
Most who meet them die having never understood they were speaking to the world’s **final editor**.

## Traits

- **Anatomy of Judgment.**  
  The Foldborne’s body is a writhing digestive organ wrapped in tethered manuscript-flesh. Any creature grappled by it takes **2d8 radiant damage** at the start of its turn.

- **Writmask Anchor.**  
  As a bonus action, the Foldborne may throw its mask up to 60 ft. (ignores line of sight). At the end of its movement, it may **teleport to any unoccupied space between itself and the mask**, then recall the mask as a free action. Creatures in the path of the mask when thrown must make a **DC 15 Dex save or take 2d6 force damage** and be knocked prone.

- **Anti-Spell Shell (Passive).**  
  Concentration checks within 10 ft. of the Foldborne are made with disadvantage. The first spell cast each round within 30 ft. of it requires a **DC 15 Cha save** or fizzles (no effect, slot lost).

- **Spatial Feedback.**  
  If the Foldborne takes force, radiant, or thunder damage, it may use its reaction to force the attacker to make a **DC 15 Dex save** or be teleported 30 ft. straight away.

---

## Actions

- **Multiattack.**  
  The Foldborne makes **three attacks**: two with **Pseudopods**, and one with **Fold-Shear** if available.

**Pseudopod.**  
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage and the target is **grappled** (DC 15 escape). If already grappled, the target takes **2d8 radiant damage** instead.

- **Fold-Shear (Recharge 5–6).**  
  The Foldborne opens a line of torn space. A 30 ft. line, 5 ft. wide, erupts from a point within 30ft of it. All creatures in the line must make a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw** or take **4d10 force damage** and fall prone. On success, half damage and no prone. Concentration, lasts up to one minute.

## Battlefield Actions

_Declared at the end of its turn. They resolve at the **start of its next turn**. Only one may be active at a time._

- **1. Heavensent**

The creature Prepares to leap upwards. Any creature starting it's turn within 5ft of the FoldBorne must make a **DC 18** Charisma save, or be thrust 100ft into the sky, then plunge downwards like a comet. When it lands on top of another creature, tashas split fall damage rules apply.

- **2. Echo of the First Contract**  
  At the start of its next turn, **each creature within 30 ft.** must make a **DC 15 Wis save** or be affected by _Command (Approach)_, even if immune to charm.

- **3. Total Reversal**  
  The Foldborne reverses space. **Switches places with up to two creatures** within 60 ft., **no save**. If either is unwilling, they take **4d8 thunder damage** and are stunned until the end of their next turn.

## Death Rattle – Mechanical Hands (1/Day)

When reduced to 0 HP, the Foldborne emits a final bell-like pulse. All creatures who have cast a spell in the last minute must make a **DC 16 Wisdom saving throw** or be **stunned until the end of their next turn**, after which the creature casts:

> **Lesser Singularity** > _5th-level conjuration (graviturgy)_
>
> **Casting Time**: 1 action
> **Range**: 120 feet
> **Components**: V, S
> **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute.
>
> You create a tiny black hole at a point you can see within range. The black hole is a sphere with a 30-foot radius. All fires and flames within 40 feet of the black magical or otherwise instantly extinguished. Each creature within 40 feet of the > black hole when it appears must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 force damage and is pulled to 5 feet closer to the black hole. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is knocked prone > but isn’t pulled toward the black hole.
>
> A creature that’s within 5 feet of the black hole at the start of its turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or take 5d10 force damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. A creature that’s within 40 feet of > the black hole (but not within 5 feet of it) at the end of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points while within 5 feet of the black hole dies immediately.

then remains at **1hp**, **invulnerable**, **during 2+1d4 rounds**, or until all nearby creatures escape the black hole, after which it dies and drops its mask.
